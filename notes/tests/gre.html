        <h3>How to Approach the "Analyze an Issue" Task</h3>
        <p><b>Step 1: Brainstorm (3 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>Once you read the task, you should spend time determining what stance you will take on the issue and what evidence you will use to support that stance.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>A good issue essay should consist of (1) an introductory paragraph that states your main point, (2) body paragraphs providing examples that reinforce this main point, and (3) a concluding paragraph that summarizes your point and its implications.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b></p>
        <p>Start with your body paragraphs because these constitute the most important part of your essay. Each body paragraph should take the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sentence 1: Topic sentence: State the point that you are trying to convey in the paragraph.</li>
          <li>Sentences 2 to 4: Example: Go into detail with the example that you are using to support your main point.</li>
          <li>Sentences 5 to 6. Reasoning: Explain how your example supports the topic sentence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 4: Write Your Introductory and Concluding Paragraphs (6 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>The goal of your introductory paragraph is twofold:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Give context for the issue you are discussing.</li>
          <li>Clearly state your thesis-the stance that you will be trying to support in the essay.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To give context, you should first explain the larger relevance of the issue. To do so, it is oftentimes helpful to address the counterargument, a rhetorical strategy in which you provide the opposite side of the argument and then segue into your own opinion.</p>
        <p>The goal of your concluding paragraph is to summarize the points you made in your essay and to discuss the implications of your main point. When discussing the implications, you should focus on addressing the relevance of your thesis to issues outside the scope of the essay.</p>
        <p><b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing-the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

        <h3>How to Approach the "Analyze an Argument" Task</h3>
        <p><b>Step 1: Read the Argument and Identify the Claim and Evidence (2 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>When reading the argument, your goal is to identify the main conclusion the author draws and the evidence that he or she uses to support this conclusion.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Identify the Major Assumptions and Create Your Outline (3 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>An assumption is an unstated piece of information that must be true for an argument to be valid.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3: Write Your Body Paragraphs (5 Minutes per Paragraph)</b></p>
        <p>In each body paragraph, you should examine a major assumption in the argument. Start by introducing the assumption. Then state why the argument actually depends on this assumption.</p>
        <p><b>Step 4: Write Your Introduction and Conclusion (7 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>In the introduction, focus on restating the author's main point, and briefly summarize why you think the argument is flawed. Make it obvious that there are important assumptions and flaws in the argument.</p>
        <p>Your conclusion does not need to include a restatement of the assumptions listed in your argument. Simply write a paragraph showing that you understand the author's perspective but find it lacking.</p>
        <p><b>Step 5: Proofread (3 Minutes)</b></p>
        <p>When proofreading, you should reread the essay carefully, focusing on any grammatical mistakes or typos you may have made. So worry less about the content and more about the technical aspects of your writing-the grammar, spelling, and fluidity of the sentences.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>You should be familiar with the directions for the Argument task and with certain key concepts, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>alternative explanation</b>: a possible competing version of what might have caused the events in question; an alternative explanation undercuts or qualifies the original explanation because it too can account for the observed facts</li>
          <li><b>analysis</b>: the process of breaking something (e.g., an argument) down into its component parts in order to understand how they work together to make up the whole</li>
          <li><b>argument</b>: a claim or a set of claims with reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or falsehood of something</li>
          <li><b>assumption</b>: a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to maintain a particular position; something that is taken for granted but that must be true in order for the conclusion to be true</li>
          <li><b>conclusion</b>: the end point reached by a line of reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the resulting assertion</li>
          <li><b>counterexample</b>: an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the argument</li>
          <li><b>evaluation</b>: an assessment of the quality of evidence and reasons in an argument and of the overall merit of an argument</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No matter which approach you take, you should</p>
        <ul>
          <li>carefully read the <b>argument</b> and the specific instructions - you might want to read them over more than once</li>
          <li>identify as many of the <b>argument</b>'s claims, <b>conclusions</b>, and underlying <b>assumptions</b> as possible and evaluate their quality</li>
          <li>think of as many <b>alternative explanations</b> and <b>counterexamples</b> as you can</li>
          <li>think of what specific additional evidence might weaken or lend support to the claims</li>
          <li>ask yourself what changes in the argument would make the reasoning more sound</li>
        </ul>

              <li>Avoiding Excessive Qualification</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h4>Avoiding Sentence Fragments and Run-Ons</h4>
          <p>Every sentence in formal expository writing must have an <b>independent clause</b>: a clause that contains a subject and a predicate. A <b>sentence fragment</b> has no independent clause; a <b>run-on sentence</b> has two or more independent clauses that are improperly connected.</p>
          <p>Beginning sentences with <b>coordinating conjunctions</b>-<b>for, and, nor, but, or, yet</b>, and <b>so</b>-is acceptable in moderation and is sometimes an effective stylistic choice to emphasize an idea. Nonetheless, check whether joining sentences with the conjunction or using an adverb, such as <b>moreover</b> or <b>however</b>, would be more effective.</p>

        <h3>The Issue Essay</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>STEP 1 Take the issue apart.</b> Read the topic and <b>consider both sides of the issue</b>. Restate the issue in your own words. Consider the other side of the issue and put that into your own words as well.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 2 Select the points you will make.</b> After you consider what both sides of the issue mean, think of reasons and examples for both sides. After coming up with at least<u>two reasons in support of one side and one reason for the other</u>, decide which side you will support or the extent to which you agree.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 3 Organize, using Kaplan's Issue essay template.</b> If some of the ideas are closely related, consider discussing them both in the same body paragraph. You may find that you don't actually have much to say about one or more of the points you jotted down-cross these out. Make sure to acknowledge at least one point the other side might bring up, but also rebut it.
          <ul>
              <li><b>Paragraph 1:</b> Paraphrase the issue (the statement, claim, recommendation, or policy) and state your position. You might begin by explaining why the issue is important or <b>worthy of discussion</b>, and you may choose to summarize the points you will make in your essay. However, your most important task here is to inform the reader of your position on the issue.</li>
              <li><b>Paragraph 2:</b> State and elaborate upon the strongest point in support of your position, within the scope of the specific instructions.</li>
              <li><b>Paragraph 3:</b> State and elaborate upon another point in support of your position, within the scope of the specific instructions.</li>
              <li><b>Additional paragraphs, as time permits:</b> If you have time and have more strong points to make, you may write additional paragraphs in which you state and elaborate upon other points in support of your position. Note that a few well-developed paragraphs will earn a higher score than many superficial paragraphs. (Time valve #1: skip if need be.)</li>
              <li><b>Next-to-last paragraph:</b> Address an opposing point to your position; then refute it with relevant detailed support. Another option is to raise and rebut counterarguments with your own arguments in each body paragraph, instead of devoting a paragraph to this purpose; just make sure your essay acknowledges at least one argument someone on the other side would make. (Time valve #2: combine with conclusion if need be.)</li>
              <li><b>Last paragraph:</b> Conclude by summarizing your position in a way that addresses the specific instructions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>STEP 4 Type your essay.</b> You shouldn't proceed with this step until you've completed the three preceding ones. You'll save time and energy by preparing your essay before you start typing it. Graders have a limited amount of time in which to read your essay, so start and conclude with strong statements. Be forceful and concise with your prose and link related ideas with transition words and phrases. When you write crisply and give clear indicators of how one idea connects to the next, you will make your writing flow and make the grader's job easier.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 5 Proofread your work.</b> Save enough time (at least a couple of minutes) to skim the entire essay. Look for errors you can address quickly: capitalization, paragraph divisions, double-typed words, miscellaneous typos, and small grammatical errors.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Argument Essay</h3>
        <p>Look carefully for unstated <b>assumptions</b> the writer makes in order to move from <b>evidence</b> to <b>conclusion</b>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>STEP 1 Take the argument apart.</b> The first step in analyzing an argument is to identify the conclusion. After you've nailed down the conclusion, your next step is to characterize the evidence used to support it.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 2 Select the points you will make.</b> Now that you clearly understand the argument, proceed to analyze it. You might do this by directly identifying the assumptions, by determining what type of evidence would fill in the gaps, or discussing whether the possibilities the author has overlooked could be better accounted for by another argument. Note, too, any terms that are ambiguous and would need definition for the argument to be clear. Finally, think of additional evidence that might be found that could strengthen or weaken the argument. Regardless of the variation in your approach, the argument will always be weak, and you will conclude your essay by saying that without additional evidence, the intended audience for the argument should be skeptical of its claim.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 3 Organize, using Kaplan's Argument essay template.</b> If some of the potential flaws in the argument are closely related, consider discussing them both in the same body paragraph. You may find that you don't feel very confident discussing one or more of the points you jotted down-cross these out. Once any weak points are crossed out and related you don't just want to find fault with the argument. Make sure to discuss the evidence that, if the author included it, would make the argument more convincing.
          <ul>
              <li><b>Paragraph 1:</b> Paraphrase the argument (the author's conclusion and evidence). Summarize the goal of your essay, according to the specific instructions. State your thesis, which is that the argument is unconvincing.</li>
              <li><b>Paragraph 2:</b> State and evaluate an important assumption the author makes, question to be answered, or possible alternative explanation (depending on the specific instructions).</li>
              <li><b>Paragraph 3:</b> State and evaluate another assumption the author makes, question to be answered, or possible alternative explanation.</li>
              <li><b>Additional paragraphs, as time permits:</b> State and evaluate additional assumptions the author makes, questions to be answered, or possible alternative explanations. (Time valve #1: skip if need be.)</li>
              <li><b>Next-to-last paragraph:</b> Do not stop at pointing out the flaws in the author's reasoning. Show what evidence, if it were true, would strengthen the argument. Another option is to discuss this evidence in each body paragraph, instead of devoting a paragraph to this purpose; just make sure your essay includes consideration of how the argument could be improved. (Time valve #2: combine with conclusion if need be.)</li>
              <li><b>Last paragraph:</b> Conclude by summarizing your main points in a way that addresses the specific instructions. State that unless additional evidence is provided, the audience for the argument should find it unpersuasive.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>STEP 4 Type your essay.</b> You shouldn't proceed with this step until you've completed the three preceding ones. Graders can give your essay a limited amount of time, so start and conclude with strong statements. Be forceful and concise with your prose and link related ideas with transition words and phrases. When you write crisply and give clear indicators of how one idea connects to the next, you will make your writing flow and earn a higher score.</li>
          <li><b>STEP 5 Proofread your work.</b> Save enough time (at least a couple of minutes) to skim the entire essay, looking for small errors that are easy to fix. Having a sense of the errors you tend to make will help you identify and repair them.</li>

          <li><b>Organize</b>. Take the ideas you've come up with and fit them into the assignment for the prompt.</li>
          <li><b>Write</b>. Once you've completed the first two steps, the final step should be a snap.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>The <b>introduction</b> should introduce the topic of the essay, discuss the issues surrounding it, and present the essay's thesis.</li>
          <li>The <b>body paragraphs</b> should use examples to support the thesis of the essay.</li>
          <li>The <b>conclusion</b> should summarize the major points of the issue, reiterate the thesis, and perhaps consider its implications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Essay Essentials</h5>
        <p>A basic essay has three parts: an introduction, some body paragraphs, and a conclusion. These three things are exactly what you should include in your Analysis of an Issue Essay. Each of these parts has a specific role to play.</p>
        <h5>Key to High Score</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>considers the complexities of the issue</li>
          <li>supports the position with relevant examples</li>
          <li>is clear and well organized</li>
          <li>demonstrates superior facility with the conventions of standard written English</li>
        </ol>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 1: THINK</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Key Terms</b>. What are the key words or phrases in the prompt? Do the terms need clarifying before you can properly deal with them in the essay?</li>
            <li><b>Opposite Side</b>. What would the converse of the statement be?</li>
            <li><b>Examples</b>. What are some examples that would support the statement? What are some examples that would support the opposite statement?</li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Key Terms</h5>
          <p>In order to make your essay as focused as possible, you might need to limit the key terms to a specific definition or interpretation. By repeatedly returning to these terms in your essay, you'll convey the impression that your essay is strongly organized and on topic. Using key terms from the prompt throughout your essay contributes to its overall coherency.</p>
          <h5>Opposite Side</h5>
          <p>In order to score well on the Issue essay, you'll have to consider both sides of the prompt. A simple "I agree, and here's why" essay won't be enough here; rather, you'll need to consider both sides of the issue and state a clear position that you can defend.</p>
          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>In general, the more specific your examples are, the better your essay score. And examples from history, literature, or current events are better than personal observations or experiences.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 2: ORGANIZE</h4>
          <h5>Separate Your Examples</h5>
          <p>Even though you might have a strong preference for one position on the issue, you might notice that the examples you brainstormed tend to support the other side of the issue. Don't expend more time trying to think of examples to support your preconceptions; just write your essay supporting the other side!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 3: WRITE</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Preconstruction: The Introduction</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>clearly <b>establishes the topic</b> of the paper</li>
              <li>previews both sides of the issue at hand</li>
              <li>presents a clear thesis</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Establish the Topic</h6>
            <p>Even though the grader will see the prompt you're writing about, he or she should be able to figure out the prompt just from reading the introduction of your essay. There are a few different ways you can quickly establish the topic.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Rhetorical Questions:</b> This approach is a tried-and-true way of introducing your topic. Instead of simply quoting or paraphrasing the prompt, turn it into a rhetorical question.</li>
              <li><b>Famous Quotations:</b> Another classic approach to beginning an essay is to use either a well-known saying or a famous quote from someone.</li>
              <li><b>Anecdote:</b> An anecdote is a brief story. Oftentimes you can grab your reader's attention and introduce the topic with a good anecdote. When using an anecdote you might have to write a sentence or two explaining the relevance of your story.</li>
              <li><b>Fact/Statistic:</b> For some topics, it might be appropriate to start your essay by stating a fact or statistic.</li>
              <li><b>Definition:</b> One way you may wish to start your essay is by defining one of the key terms from the prompt. The advantage to this approach is that you already spent some time thinking along these lines when you were planning your essay.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Preview the Issue</h6>
            <p>Once you've told the reader what the topic is, your next task is to inform the reader of the issues at hand. You want to briefly touch on both sides of the debate, explaining the pros and cons of the prompt. A good way to accomplish this is to make use of strong transition words-words like <i>but, despite, while,</i> and <i>although</i>. Here are some examples.</p>
            <h6>Present the Thesis</h6>
            <p>A more important consideration when writing your thesis is giving some indication of why you hold your particular position. You should make it clear that you've thought about and analyzed the issue. Here are some examples of thesis statements. For each thesis, you can see that the author is also giving some justification for the viewpoint. This justification will be of course explored more thoroughly in the body paragraphs, but it's good to give a preview of how your essay will take shape.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Preconstruction: Body Paragraphs</h5>
            <ol>
              <li>use a good transition/topic sentence</li>
              <li>present an example</li>
              <li>explain how the example supports the thesis</li>
            </ol>
            <h6>Transition/Topic Sentence</h6>
            <p>Of course, you might want to avoid using simple transitions like "the first example," and "the second example." The important point is that each sentence introduces the example and reminds the reader of the purpose of the example.</p>
            <h6>Explain the Example</h6>
            <p>The purpose of the Issue essay is not to just list some examples; the purpose is to develop and support a position on the issue. Just as the topic of the essay should be clear from the introduction, the thesis should be clear from each body paragraph.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Preconstruction: Conclusion</h5>
            <p>Your essay should always have a conclusion, for two reasons. First, a conclusion paragraph is evidence of good organization. It shows that you knew exactly what points you wanted to make, you made them, and now you're ending the essay. And second, an essay that lacks a conclusion seems incomplete, almost as if your writing abruptly ends before it should. This can give a negative impression of your essay. Some test takers even prefer to write their introduction and conclusion first and then fill in the body paragraphs. This strategy has the advantage of making your essay seem complete even if you happen to run out of time writing the body paragraphs. Fortunately, conclusion paragraphs are easy to write. A good conclusion:</p>
            <h6>Summarize Main Points</h6>
            <p>Your conclusion should mention the thesis and how the examples support it. Additionally, you can briefly consider the implications of the thesis.</p>

        <h3>The Argument Essay</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>THE PARTS OF AN ARGUMENT</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>the <b>conclusion</b>-the author's opinion and recommendation for action</li>
            <li>the <b>premises</b>-the facts the author uses to back up his or her opinion</li>
            <li>the <b>assumptions</b>-unstated conditions that must be true in order for the argument to make sense</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Conclusion Words</b>: <b><i>so</i></b>, <b><i>therefore</i></b>, <b><i>thus</i></b>, <b><i>hence</i></b>, <b><i>showed that</i></b>, <b><i>clearly</i></b>, <b><i>then</i></b>, <b><i>consequently</i></b>, <b><i>as a result</i></b>, <b><i>concluded that</i></b></p>
          <p><b>Premise Words</b>: <b><i>because</i></b>, <b><i>since</i></b>, <b><i>if</i></b>, <b><i>given that</i></b>, <b><i>in view of</i></b>, <b><i>in light of</i></b>, <b><i>assume</i></b></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>ASSUMPTIONS</h4>
          <p>An assumption is an unstated premise that supports the author's conclusion. There are three types of arguments you are likely to see. They are Sampling, Analogy, and Causal.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>The Sampling Assumption:</b> A sampling argument assumes that a small group is representative of a much larger group to which it belongs. To attack a sampling argument, show that one cannot assume that the opinions or experiences of the smaller group are necessarily representative of the larger group.</li>
            <li><b>The Analogy Assumption:</b> An argument by analogy assumes that A = B or that what is true for one entity will be true for another. To attack an argument by analogy, simply show that the two groups or places or individuals are nothing like each other. What is true for one does not have to be true of the other.</li>
            <li><b>The Causal Assumption:</b> A causal argument assumes that A causes B, or that if you remove the cause, you will remove the effect. While there may be a strong correlation between A and B, it does not always follow that it is a causal relationship or that A is the cause of B. To attack a causal relationship, point out that there are other possible causes for B and brainstorm some possible examples.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>WRITING THE ARGUMENT ESSAY</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Read the topic and identify the conclusion and the premises.</li>
            <li>Look for gaps in the argument, weaknesses in the logic, and new information in the conclusion that wasn't present in the premises. Brainstorm as many different assumptions as you can think of. Write these out on your scratch paper or on the computer screen.</li>
            <li>Select three or four of the strongest assumptions around which to build your essay.</li>
            <li>Choose a template that allows you to attack the assumptions in an organized way.</li>
            <li>Write the essay, using all the tools and techniques that you'll be learning in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Read over the essay and edit it.</li>

      <h2>My Verbal Reasoning</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>My Completion</h3>
        <p>Start with the easiest blank-<b>the one with the most obvious clue</b> for multi blank questions. The answer for Sentence Equivalence are always <b>synonyms</b>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Identify the Contextual Clue:</b> Determine the intended meaning of the passage, based on the information in the passage. Find the <b>clue</b> in the sentence that provides insight into the word or phrase that goes in the blank. An <b>adjective</b> will be easiest to work with, because then the blank merely <b>describes the noun next to the blank</b>. If it's a <b>verb</b> that's missing, the blank describes <b>some action or process</b>. If it's <b>noun</b> that's missing, the blank represents <b>a person, thing, or idea-or often some aspect of another noun</b> in the passage.</li>
          <li><b>Identify the Transition Words:</b> Transition words tell the reader how a clue relates to the blank-whether the clue has the same meaning as the blank or the opposite meaning.
          <ul>
              <li><b>Contrast Transitions:</b> But, Yet, Nonetheless, Nevertheless, Despite, In spite of, In contrast, Contrasted with, Opposed to, Although, However, On the contrary, Rather than, Still, Though, Unless, While, On the other hand, Unfortunately, Conversely, Whereas, Even though, Instead, Belied</li>
              <li><b>Continuity Transitions:</b> Indeed, And, Also, Moreover, Furthermore, In addition, In fact, Thus, Therefore, Consequently, Due to, Because, Since, As a result, Hence, So, Likewise, Similarly, Next, Accordingly, For example, Besides, Just as, ; (semicolon), : (colon)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Predict Your Own Word for the Blank:</b> You're just trying to come up with something that reflects the clues and will help you to identify the correct answer from among the choices. Just <b>use a word or phrase recycled from the clues</b>.</li>
          <li><b>Select the Answer That Best Matches Your Prediction:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on the words you know.</li>

          <section>
            <h5>Active Reading</h5>
            <p>Try to find the main point first, using the following methods:</p>
            <section>
              <h6>Unpack the Beginning</h6>
              <p>The steps to unpacking a complex sentence are as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Grab a concrete noun first.</b> Pick something that you can touch and that causes other things to happen. Do not necessarily pick something at the start of the sentence.</li>
                <li><b>Turn actions back into verbs.</b> In academic language, verbs are often made into noun or adjective phrases. Re-create the verbs. Also, feel free to start with <i>There is</i> or <i>There was</i>.</li>
                <li><b>Put only <i>one</i> simple thought in a sentence.</b></li>
                <li><b>Link each subsequent sentence to the previous one, using</b> <b><i>this or these</i>.</b> For instance, <i>This resulted in ...</i> This process mimics speech, which is usually easy to understand.</li>
                <li><b>Simplify or "quote off" details.</b> If a jargon word is used in an important way, put quotes around it. Think to yourself, "<i>Whatever that means</i> ..." and keep going. If the term is necessary, you will figure it out from context later.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Principle 1: Identify the Main Purpose</h6>
              <p>To identify a passage's main purpose, you should focus on <b>contrast signals</b> and <b>continuity signals</b>. When you see a contextual signal in a sentence. Usually, that sentence will either <b>determine the main purpose</b> of the passage or <b>provide a transition into the passage's main purpose.</b></p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Principle 2: Understand the Role of Evidence</h6>
              <p><b>Everything the author says will somehow relate to his main point.</b> Focus on the <b>first and last sentence of each paragraph</b>, and use those sentences to understand the <b>role the paragraph plays</b> in the overall passage. There are important contextual clues for the introduction of evidence: <b>For example</b>, <b>For instance</b>, <b>Indeed</b>, <b>Because of</b>, <b>As a result of</b>, <b>Since</b> <b>Illustrated by</b>, <b>Shown by</b>, <b>Evidence for</b></p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Principle 3: Identify the Author's Tone</h6>
              <p><b>Tone</b> refers to the author's attitude toward the subject matter in the passage. To identify tone, look for <b>valenced</b> words in the passage. If the author uses words like <b>fortunately</b> or thankfully, you know that the author feels <u>positively</u> about whatever he is discussing, whereas words like <b>regrettably</b> indicate that the author feels <u>negatively</u> about the content matter of the passage. Identifying tone is important not only because some questions explicitly ask about tone, but also because you can use the author's tone to <b>eliminate wrong answer choices</b>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Understanding the Structures</h6>
              <p>Here are the different types of key words that will help you locate central ideas and opinions and grasp the structure of the passage:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Emphasis</b> key words, such as <i>very</i> and <i>critical</i>, <u>point to ideas that are important to the author</u>.</li>
                <li><b>Opinion</b> key words, such as <i>beneficial</i> or <i>dead end</i>, emphasize a positive or negative charge and <u>point to attitudes toward or judgments about ideas</u>.</li>
                <li><b>Contrast</b> key words such as <i>but</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, and <i>on the other hand</i> tell you that <u>a change or disagreement is coming</u>.</li>
                <li><b>Continuation</b> key words such as <i>moreover</i>, <i>furthermore</i>, <i>also</i>, and <i>in addition</i> tell you to <u>expect more of the same line of reasoning</u>.</li>
                <li><b>Illustration</b> key words let you know that <u>what follows is an example of a broader point</u>. One example, of course, is <i>example</i>. <i>For instance</i> is another favorite in GRE passages.</li>
                <li><b>Sequence</b> key words <u>delineate how events or characteristics are related</u>. <i>First, second,</i> and <i>third</i> are examples, as is a sequence like <i>17th century</i>, <i>18th century</i>, and <i>today</i>.</li>
                <li><b>Evidence</b> key words like <i>because</i>, <i>since</i>, and <i>for</i> <u>announce the reasons used to support that conclusion</u>.</li>
                <li><b>Conclusion</b> key words such as <i>therefore</i> and <i>thus</i> <u>indicate a supported claim or main point</u>.</li>

            <section>
              <h6>Main Point Questions</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>The <b>primary purpose</b> of the passage is to . . .</li>
                <li>The author's <b>primary purpose</b> is to . . .</li>
                <li>The author is <b>primarily concerned</b> with . . .</li>
                <li>Which of the following would be an appropriate <b>title for the passage</b>?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The answer to any <b>main-point</b> question will encompass the entire scope of the passage. Oftentimes, there will be choices that provide information that is true about the passage but that does not fully address the entire purpose of the passage.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Detail Questions</h6>
              <p>Detail questions can be phrased as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"According to the passage . . ."</li>
                <li>"Based on the passage, which of the following is true . . ."</li>
                <li>"The author mentions which of the following . . ."</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To answer a detail question, you should focus on finding specific text from the passage that answers the question. For detail questions, you do not need to make any inferences and should avoid making assumptions. Instead, look at each choice, and identify which choice is best supported by concrete evidence from the passage.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Inference Questions</h6>
              <p>Inference questions can be phrased as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"The passage suggests . . ."</li>
                <li>"The passage implies" . . ."</li>
                <li>"Which of the following can be inferred from the passage . . ."</li>
                <li>"Which of the following can be concluded from the passage . . ."</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Inference</b> questions are very similar to detail questions. As is the case with detail questions, with inference questions you should focus on identifying concrete textual evidence to justify your answer. The primary difference is the following: <b>To answer an inference question, you must draw a conclusion based on information in the passage</b>. With inference questions, the actual answer will <b>never be explicitly</b> stated in the passage. Instead, it will be <b>implied</b> by what the author says. To answer these questions, look for which choices can be directly inferred from the given information in the passage.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Select-in-Passage Questions</h6>
              <p>In Select-in-Passage questions, you will be asked to highlight a sentence in the passage that corresponds to the information that the question asks for. These questions will usually be phrased as "<b>Select the sentence in which the author</b> . . ."</p>

            <h5>USE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION</h5>
            <section>
              <h6>Avoid Extreme Statements</h6>
              <p>Certain words make choices extreme and, therefore, easy to dispute. Here are a few of these words. <b>must</b>, <b>the first</b>, <b>each</b>, <b>every</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>the best</b>, <b>only</b>, <b>totally</b>, <b>always</b>, <b>no</b></p>
              <p>You shouldn't automatically eliminate a choice that contains one of these words, but you should turn your attention to it immediately and attack it vigorously. If you can find even one exception, you can eliminate that choice.</p>
              <p>Other words make choices moderate, more mushy, and therefore hard to dispute. Here are a few of these words. <b>may</b>, <b>can</b>, <b>some</b>, <b>many</b>, <b>sometimes</b>, <b>often</b></p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Half Right = All Wrong</h6>
              <p>Remember that your job is to find flaws in answer choices and eliminate them. Look for reasons to eliminate them. One word can make an answer choice wrong if that word isn't supported by the passage.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Beyond the Information Given</h6>
              <p>Be careful not to answer questions based on the fact that you did your undergraduate thesis on the topic. The answers are in the passage; don't use outside knowledge.</p>

            <h5>Misc</h5>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Five Up/Five Down.</b> If they highlight a portion of the passage, start reading five lines above and read until five lines below the highlighted passage. This way, you are always looking at things <i>in context.</i></li>
              <li><b>Lead Word.</b> A lead word is any word in the question that will be easy to skim for in the passage. Names, numbers, dates, large technical terms all make good lead words. Of course, once you find your lead word, read five lines up and five lines down (for a vocab-in-context question, you need to read only three lines up and three lines down).</li>

          <h4>Argument-based passages</h4>
          <p>The passage will present information and a claim drawn from that information. Your task will be to identify information that most impacts the argument by strengthening it, weakening it, providing an assumption, or resolving an apparent discrepancy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>First, identify the argument.</b> The <b>argument</b> is an opinion drawn in the passage based on certain evidence. The evidence used to support the opinion is called the <b>premise</b> or premises, and the opinion the author draws is called the <b>claim</b>. <b>argument = premise + claim</b>.
            <ul>
                <li>To identify the claim of the passage, look for words such as: <b>as a result</b>, <b>belief</b>, <b>consequently</b>, <b>hypothesis</b>, <b>in conclusion</b>, <b>may</b>, <b>might</b>, <b>nevertheless</b>, <b>nonetheless</b>, <b>predicts</b>, <b>probably</b>, <b>therefore</b>, <b>thus</b>, <b>will</b>. These are good claim signals because such words generally <b>introduce a belief that can be disputed</b>. If something in the passage can be disputed, then it is a claim, not a fact.</li>
                <li>To identify the premises of the passage, look for words such as:<b>since</b>, <b>because</b>, <b>due to</b>, <b>owing to</b>, <b>as a result of</b>. All of these phrases play the role of providing evidence that leads to a conclusion. Thus when you see these phrases, you should be on the lookout for the author's main claim.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Think about assumptions made in the argument.</b> You can think of an <b>assumption</b> as the glue that holds the premises and claim together. Basically, it is a piece of evidence that is <b>necessary</b> for the conclusion to logically follow from the premises.</li>
            <li><b>Finally, go through the choices.</b> When going through the choices, your goal is to identify the choice that best addresses the link between the premises and the claim:
            <ul>
                <li>In a <b>strengthen</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that strengthens the link.</li>
                <li>In a <b>weaken</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that breaks the link between premise and conclusion.</li>
                <li>In an <b>assumption</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that is necessary for the conclusion to be drawn from the premises.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

            <h5>CRACKING CRITICAL REASONING QUESTIONS</h5>
            <section>
              <h6>Strengthen Questions</h6>
              <p>Strengthen questions will ask you to make the argument stronger. You'll be asked to do this by identifying answer choices that will support the assumption. Strengthen questions are often phrased as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?</li>
                <li>Which of the following, if true, would most support the author's argument?</li>
                <li>Supporters of the argument would most likely cite which of following pieces of additional evidence?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you're using POE on Strengthen questions, always eliminate answer choices that</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Are Only Half Good</b>. Some answers will be on the right track, but they won't strengthen the argument enough. Again, remember that you're looking for the <i>correct</i> answer, not an answer that might be good enough.</p>
                <li><b>Weaken the Argument</b>. Typically, one of the answer choices will weaken the argument. Unless your task is to weaken the argument, you can easily eliminate it.</p>
                <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Some answer choices do nothing to the argument; they neither strengthen nor weaken it. Get rid of these; they're decoys.</p>
              </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Weaken Questions</h6>
              <p>It follows, then, that if you attack the assumption, you will weaken the argument. You can identify Weaken questions by looking for the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument?</li>
                <li>Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the argument above?</li>
                <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the author's argument?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The guidelines for Weaken questions are basically the same as those for Strengthen questions. Eliminate any answer choices that</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Are Half Good</b>. Make sure the answer attacks the assumption thoroughly.</li>
                <li><b>Strengthen the Argument</b>. Once again, one answer usually does the opposite of the question task-eliminate the odd man out.</li>
                <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Some answer choices neither strengthen nor weaken the argument: Eliminate them.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Inference Questions</h6>
              <p>An inference is a conclusion that's based on a set of given facts. You can identify Inference questions because they'll look a lot like the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?</li>
                <li>Which of the following statements can be properly inferred from the information above?</li>
                <li>Based on the information above, which of the following can logically be concluded?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>On Inference questions, eliminate answer choices that</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Go Beyond the Information</b>. Stick to the facts on inference questions. Avoid answers that are overly broad or general.</li>
                <li><b><i>Could</i></b> <b>Be True</b>. The correct answer on an inference <i>must</i> be true. Answers that might be true or could be true are no good.</li>
                <li><b>Use Extreme Language</b>. Be suspicious of strong language. The presence of words such as <i>all, none, always, never,</i> or <i>impossible</i> often means that an answer choice is wrong.</li>
              </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h6>Resolve/Explain</h6>
              <p>Some Critical Reasoning questions will present you with a paradox-a set of facts that seem to contradict each other. On these questions, your task is to find the answer choice that best explains the contradiction. You can recognize these questions because they often contain the following phrases:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Which of the following choices would best explain the situation presented above?</li>
                <li>Which of the following, if true, would best resolve the discrepancy above?</li>
                <li>Which of the following, if true, best reconciles the seeming paradox above?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>On Resolve/Explain questions, you should eliminate answer choices that</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Many wrong answers simply do nothing to the paradox.</li>
                <li><b>Are Only Half Right</b>. Some answers will deal with only half of the conflict. Make sure the answer you select addresses both facts.</li>
                <li><b>Worsen the Situation</b>. Eliminate choices that appear to make the situation worse.</li>
              </ol>

        <h3>Text Completion</h3>
        <p>Your task is to use the <b>context</b> of the sentence to select the choice that best fits in the blank. The best method is to <b>predict the answer</b> and then see which choice matches your prediction by identifying the <b>contextual clues</b>. Contextual clues are words or phrases that link elements of a sentence. These clues help provide a logical structure for understanding the relationship between the sentence's different components.</p>
        <p>Contextual clues will typically fall into three categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Contrast signals:</b> but, yet, nonetheless, nevertheless, despite, in spite of, in contrast, contrasted with, opposed to, although, however, on the contrary, rather than, still, though</li>
          <li><b>Continuity signals:</b> indeed, and, also, moreover, furthermore, in addition, in fact, semicolon (;), colon (:)</li>
          <li><b>Cause-effect signals:</b> thus, therefore, consequently, due to, because, since, as a result, hence, so</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's look at the steps for answering a typical Text Completion question.</p>
        <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Contextual Clue</b></p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Determine the Contextual Clue's Relationship with the Rest of the Sentence</b></p>
        <p><b>Step 3: Predict Your Own Word for the Blank From Step 2</b></p>

        <h3>Sentence Equivalence</h3>
        <p>However, one key difference between the two question types is the fact that you must select <b>two</b> words for the blank in Sentence Equivalence questions. Though it might appear that this format makes Sentence Equivalence questions more difficult, you can take advantage of this fact by recognizing that <b>the correct answers will almost always be synonyms</b>.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Of the 20 questions that you will see in each scored Verbal section, approximately 9 will be Reading Comprehension questions. Reading Comprehension questions can be divided into two categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Information-based passages.</b> These passages can be classified as "long" or "short." A <b>long</b> passage is generally <b>three to four paragraphs</b> and 500+ words. Each long passage will have <b>four associated questions</b>. You can expect to see <b>one long passage</b> on your test. A <b>short</b> passage is generally <b>one to two paragraphs</b> and 100 to 300 words. Each short passage will have <b>one to four associated questions</b>, though most of the time there will be two or three questions. You can expect to see <b>five to six short passages</b> on your test. For both long and short passages, the questions concern <u>the meaning of the passage</u>, <u>the author's purpose</u>, <u>details about the passage</u>, <u>inferences that can be drawn from the passage</u>, and <u>application of the passage's information to other contexts</u>.</li>
            <li><b>Argument-based passages.</b> Each of these passages has <b>a single associated question</b>. An argument-based passage will always be <b>one paragraph</b> (and sometimes as short as a sentence) and will always have one associated multiple-choice question. You can expect to see <b>four to six argument-based passages</b> on your test. For argument-based passages, the questions concern the logic and structure of an argument. Typical questions will ask you <u>to find an assumption in the argument</u>, <u>to find ways to strengthen or weaken the argument</u>, and <u>to identify the logical structure of the passage</u>.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Information-based passages</h4>
          <p>Focus on how to be an <b>efficient, active reader</b>. Ask yourself <b>big-picture</b> questions about the passage and identifying concrete, <b>textual</b> evidence in support of your answers. Remember that <b>you should always read the passage first</b></p>
          <section>
            <h5>Principle 1: Engage Yourself with the Text</h5>
            <p>On GRE passages, you need to read <b>actively</b>, with an eye toward the passage's <b>structure</b>. As you read through the passage, you should always be asking yourself questions. <b>What's the author's main point?</b> <b>Why is she telling me this?</b> <b>How does this detail relate to the passage's overall purpose?</b></p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Principle 2: Slow Down, Then Speed Up</h5>
            <p>The beginning of a passage always introduces essential information. It will introduce key people or terms, important phenomena, the background for a theory, or in many cases, the <b>passage's main point</b>. <b>Make sure that you understand all the terms and information introduced at the beginning of the passage.</b></p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Principle 3: Identify the Main Purpose</h5>
            <p>This means asking yourself: <b>"Why did the author write the passage?"</b> Many test-takers tend to answer this question by giving a list of what the author said, but this is not the answer that you're looking for. <b>In one sentence, you should be able to say why the author wrote the passage.</b></p>
            <p>To identify a passage's main idea, you should focus on <b>contrast signals</b> and <b>continuity signals</b>. When you see a contextual signal in a sentence. Usually, that sentence will either <b>determine the main purpose</b> of the passage or <b>provide a transition into the passage's main purpose.</b> Generally, the author's purpose will fall into four categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Explain.</b> The author's goal is to <u>explain a concept or phenomenon</u>.</li>
              <li><b>Resolve/reconcile.</b> The author's goal is to <b>resolve two or more competing viewpoints</b>.</li>
              <li><b>Introduce.</b> The author's goal is to introduce a surprising discovery, phenomenon, or perspective</li>
              <li><b>Solve.</b> The author's goal is to provide a solution or answer to a question presented in the passage.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Principle 4: Understand the Role of Evidence</h5>
            <p><b>Everything the author says will somehow relate to his main point.</b> Focus on the <b>first and last sentence of each paragraph</b>, and use those sentences to understand the <b>role the paragraph plays</b> in the overall passage. There are important contextual clues for the introduction of evidence: <b>For example</b>, <b>For instance</b>, <b>Indeed</b>, <b>Because of</b>, <b>As a result of</b>, <b>Since</b> <b>Illustrated by</b>, <b>Shown by</b>, <b>Evidence for</b></p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Principle 5: Identify the Author's Tone</h5>
            <p><b>Tone</b> refers to the author's attitude toward the subject matter in the passage. To identify tone, look for <b>valenced</b> words in the passage. If the author uses words like <b>fortunately</b> or thankfully, you know that the author feels <u>positively</u> about whatever he is discussing, whereas words like <b>regrettably</b> indicate that the author feels <u>negatively</u> about the content matter of the passage. Identifying tone is important not only because some questions explicitly ask about tone, but also because you can use the author's tone to <b>eliminate wrong answer choices</b>.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Question Types</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Main-Point Questions</h5>
            <p>Main-point questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"The primary purpose of the passage is to . . ."</li>
              <li>"The author's primary purpose is to . . ."</li>
              <li>"The author is primarily concerned with . . ."</li>
              <li>"Which of the following would be an appropriate title for the passage?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The answer to any <b>main-point</b> question will encompass the entire scope of the passage. Oftentimes, there will be choices that provide information that is true about the passage but that does not fully address the entire purpose of the passage.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Detail Questions</h5>
            <p>Detail questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"According to the passage . . ."</li>
              <li>"Based on the passage, which of the following is true . . ."</li>
              <li>"The author mentions which of the following . . ."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To answer a detail question, you should focus on finding specific text from the passage that answers the question. For detail questions, you do not need to make any inferences and should avoid making assumptions. Instead, look at each choice, and identify which choice is best supported by concrete evidence from the passage.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Inference Questions</h5>
            <p>Inference questions can be phrased as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"The passage suggests . . ."</li>
              <li>"The passage implies" . . ."</li>
              <li>"Which of the following can be inferred from the passage . . ."</li>
              <li>"Which of the following can be concluded from the passage . . ."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Inference</b> questions are very similar to detail questions. As is the case with detail questions, with inference questions you should focus on identifying concrete textual evidence to justify your answer. The primary difference is the following: <b>To answer an inference question, you must draw a conclusion based on information in the passage</b>. With inference questions, the actual answer will <b>never be explicitly</b> stated in the passage. Instead, it will be <b>implied</b> by what the author says. To answer these questions, look for which choices can be directly inferred from the given information in the passage.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Select-in-Passage Questions</h5>
            <p>In Select-in-Passage questions, you will be asked to highlight a sentence in the passage that corresponds to the information that the question asks for. These questions will usually be phrased as "<b>Select the sentence in which the author</b> . . ."</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Argument-based passages</h4>
          <p>The passage will present information and a claim drawn from that information. Your task will be to identify information that most impacts the argument by strengthening it, weakening it, providing an assumption, or resolving an apparent discrepancy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, identify the argument. The <b>argument</b> is an opinion drawn in the passage based on certain evidence. The evidence used to support the opinion is called the <b>premise</b> or premises, and the opinion the author draws is called the <b>claim</b>. <b>argument = premise + claim</b>. To identify the claim of the passage, look for words such as: <b>as a result</b>, <b>belief</b>, <b>consequently</b>, <b>hypothesis</b>, <b>in conclusion</b>, <b>may</b>, <b>might</b>, <b>nevertheless</b>, <b>nonetheless</b>, <b>predicts</b>, <b>probably</b>, <b>therefore</b>, <b>thus</b>, <b>will</b>. These are good claim signals because such words generally <b>introduce a belief that can be disputed</b>. If something in the passage can be disputed, then it is a claim, not a fact. To identify the premises of the passage, look for words such as:<b>since</b>, <b>because</b>, <b>due to</b>, <b>owing to</b>, <b>as a result of</b>. All of these phrases play the role of providing evidence that leads to a conclusion. Thus when you see these phrases, you should be on the lookout for the author's main claim.</li>
            <li>Once you have identified the claim and premises of the passage, your next step is to think about assumptions made in the argument. You can think of an <b>assumption</b> as the glue that holds the premises and claim together. Basically, it is a piece of evidence that is <b>necessary</b> for the conclusion to logically follow from the premises.</li>
            <li>Finally, go through the choices. When going through the choices, your goal is to identify the choice that best addresses the link between the premises and the claim:
            <ul>
                <li>In a <b>strengthen</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that strengthens the link.</li>
                <li>In a <b>weaken</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that breaks the link between premise and conclusion.</li>
                <li>In an <b>assumption</b> question, you are looking for a piece of information that is necessary for the conclusion to be drawn from the premises.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h4>STEP 1 Read the sentence, looking for clues.</h4>
          <p>A road sign is a structural key word that signals a connection between ideas; it also determines the direction of the relationship.</p>
          <p>"Straight-ahead" road signs are used to make one part of the sentence <b>support</b> or elaborate upon another part. They continue the sentence in the <b>same</b> direction. The positive or negative connotation of what follows is not changed by these clues. The following are the example of this kind of sign: <b>And</b>, <b>Since</b>, <b>Also</b>, <b>Thus</b>, <b>Because</b>, <b>; (semicolon)</b>, <b>Likewise</b>, <b>Moreover</b>, <b>Similarly</b>, <b>In addition</b>, <b>Consequently</b></p>
          <p>"Detour" road signs change the direction of the sentence. They make one part of the sentence <b>contradict</b> or qualify another part. They continue the sentence in <b>different</b> direction. The positive or negative connotation of an answer is changed by these clues. The following are the examples of this kind of sign: <b>But</b>, <b>Despite</b>, <b>Yet</b>, <b>However</b>, <b>Unless</b>, <b>Rather</b>, <b>Although</b>, <b>While</b>, <b>On the other hand</b>, <b>Unfortunately</b>, <b>Nonetheless</b>, <b>Conversely</b></p>

          <p>Once you've found the road sign and the key word(s) relevant to the blank, predict an answer for the blank. Your prediction just needs to be a paraphrase that logically fits into the sentence. By predicting, you avoid the temptation of trying every answer choice on its own.</p>

        <h3>Reading Comprehension</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 1 Read the passage strategically.</h4>
          <p>Noting the big-picture information means identifying the <b>topic</b>, <b>scope</b>, and <b>purpose</b> of a passage. The <u>topic</u> is what the passage is about, very broadly stated. The <u>scope</u> is that specific aspect of the topic that interests the author. The <u>purpose</u> is the author's reason for writing the passage.</p>
          <p>The purpose of a passage include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To <b>explain</b> an aspect of a topic</li>
            <li>To <b>describe</b> the features of a thing or event</li>
            <li>To <b>analyze</b> how something works</li>
            <li>To <b>compare and contrast</b> two or more things-the author may simply describe how they are similar and/or different, or the author may also express an opinion about which is better</li>
            <li>To critique or <b>evaluate</b> how well or poorly something achieves a purpose-the author may only present other people's critiques or may offer her own opinion</li>
            <li>To <b>argue</b> for a position-the author has an opinion</li>
            <li>To <b>rebut</b> someone's position-the author disagrees with someone else's opinion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Writing down the topic, scope, and purpose, as in the examples above, as well as the following information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Main idea of each paragraph</li>
            <li>Any opinion(s) offered-whose opinion and what it is</li>
            <li>Definition of any specialized term(s) central to the main idea</li>
            <li>Key examples-a few words identifying the example and what idea it illustrates</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here are the different types of key words that will help you locate central ideas and opinions and grasp the structure of the passage:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Emphasis</b> and <b>opinion</b> key words are used when the author wants to call attention to a specific point. These come in two varieties. Emphasis key words, such as <i>very</i> and <i>critical</i>, point to ideas that are important to the author. Opinion key words, such as <i>beneficial</i> or <i>dead end</i>, emphasize a positive or negative charge and point to attitudes toward or judgments about ideas. These opinions are frequently the focus of GRE questions. Be sure to distinguish between the author's opinions and those of others.</li>
            <li><b>Contrast</b> key words such as <i>but</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, and <i>on the other hand</i> tell you that a change or disagreement is coming.</li>
            <li><b>Continuation</b> key words such as <i>moreover</i>, <i>furthermore</i>, <i>also</i>, and <i>in addition</i> tell you to expect more of the same line of reasoning.</li>
            <li><b>Logic</b> key words, which play an important role in answering Reasoning questions, alert you to an argument. <b>Conclusion</b> key words such as <i>therefore</i> and <i>thus</i> indicate a supported claim or main point. <b>Evidence</b> key words like <i>because</i>, <i>since</i>, and <i>for</i> announce the reasons used to support that conclusion. Again, be careful to distinguish between an argument the author is making and someone else's argument, which the author may be explaining without taking a position, agreeing with, or rebutting.</li>
            <li><b>Illustration</b> key words let you know that what follows is an example of a broader point. One example, of course, is <i>example</i>. <i>For instance</i> is another favorite in GRE passages.</li>
            <li><b>Sequence/Grouping</b> key words delineate how events or characteristics are related. <i>First, second,</i> and <i>third</i> are examples, as is a sequence like <i>17th century</i>, <i>18th century</i>, and <i>today</i>. Science passages may group complicated phenomena using simpler key words (<i>at a higher temperature</i> and <i>at a lower temperature</i>, for example). Look for these key words especially in passages explaining steps in a scientific, social, or artistic process.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 2 Analyze the question stem.</h4>
          <p>The questions that accompany a passage almost always fall into one of just a handful of categories</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Global</b>. These ask about the passage as a whole. Look for language in the question stem that asks you to determine a passage's <b>main idea</b>, <b>primary purpose</b>, or overall structure. Here are some examples of Global question stems:
            <ul>
                <li>Which of the following most accurately describes the <b>primary purpose</b> of the passage?</li>
                <li>The <b>author's tone</b> could best be described as</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Detail</b>. These ask you to research the text and identify a specific detail mentioned in the passage. Look for language in the question stem such as "<b>according to</b> the author" or "is <b>mentioned</b> in the passage." Here are some examples of Detail question stems:
            <ul>
                <li><b>According</b> the passage, the primary cause of unemployment in micronations is a lack of</li>
                <li>Which of the following was <b>mentioned</b> in the passage as a result of high employment?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Inference</b>. These questions ask for something that, though not stated explicitly in the text, must be true based on the information that is provide in the passage. Look for language in the question stem like "suggests," "implies," or "<b>most likely</b> agrees." Here are some examples of Inference question stems:
            <ul>
                <li>The passage most strongly <b>suggests</b> that which of the following is true?</li>
                <li>With which of the following characterizations of medieval comedies would the author <b>most likely</b> agree?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Logic</b>. This type of question asks you to describe why the author included a certain word, phrase, or statement. Look for language like "in order to" or "primarily serves to." Here are some examples of Logic question stems:
            <ul>
                <li>The author mentions Tussey's theory of copyright systems primarily <b>in order to</b></li>
                <li>Which of the following most accurately describes <b>the reason the author</b> included the results of the experiments in lines 9-12?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Vocab-in-Context</b>. These relatively straightforward questions ask you to identify the specific way a word is used in the passage. Here are some examples of Vocab-in-Context questions:
            <ul>
                <li>As it is used in line 16, "brilliant" most nearly means</li>
                <li>Which of the following most closely corresponds to the meaning of the word "effect" as it is used in line 26?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Reasoning</b>. These questions ask you to analyze an author's reasoning in an argument. They may ask you to identify an argument's assumption, point out a flaw in the author's reasoning, or strengthen or weaken the reasoning. Here are some examples of Reasoning questions:
            <ul>
                <li>The ethicist's argument requires the assumption that</li>
                <li>Which of the following would cast the most doubt on the conclusion drawn by the scholar?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 3 Research the relevant text in the passage.</h4>
          <p><b>Global</b> questions and some <b>Inference</b> and <b>Logic</b> questions are so general that you can simply use your understanding of the passage's topic, <b>scope</b>, and <b>purpose</b> as well as the structure of the passage to answer them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Global.</b> Attack Global questions by using the topic, scope, and purpose you noted as you read the passage. <i>Eliminate</i> answers that reflect only a part of the passage or supporting ideas rather than the main idea.</li>
            <li><b>Detail.</b> You will have to use your knowledge of the passage or your passage map to research the relevant part of the passage. <i>Eliminate</i> answer choices that distort what the author actually said about the matter at issue or that provide a correct detail about something else.</li>
            <li><b>Inference.</b> For Inference questions that give specific research clues, consult the specific part of the passage referenced in the question. Focus on key words that surround the relevant text in the passage. When evaluating answer choices for Inference questions, <i>eliminate</i> choices that reflect the author's (or someone else's) opinion but are worded too strongly (are Extreme) and those that are reasonable statements but wander beyond the scope of the passage (Outside the Scope).</li>
            <li><b>Logic.</b> Logic questions often contain line references or quote specific text from the passage. Consult your passage map for the author's overall purpose and for notes you've made about the specific part of the passage the referenced quote or phrase is from. Then go to the passage and read before and after the referenced text. Your task for these questions is to understand why the author included something in the passage, so consider how the passage would be affected if the reference text were not there. What function does it serve in the larger context of the passage? <i>Eliminate</i> choices that do not align with the author's purpose in writing.</li>
            <li><b>Vocab-in-Context.</b> These questions are relatively straightforward, and researching is often simply a matter of finding the word in question in the passage, then considering how that word is used in context. The words asked about will have more than one meaning, usually a common one, and one or more uncommon ones, and often the author has used the word for a less common meaning. Ask: What word could one use to replace the word referenced in the question? Use that prediction as you evaluate the answer choices.</li>
            <li><b>Reasoning.</b> In Reasoning questions, you will most often be asked to analyze an argument, so your first task should be to identify the argument's conclusion and its evidence. The conclusion of an argument is simply the <b>claim</b> that the author is trying to convince you of; the <b>evidence</b>, then, is the information used to support that conclusion. Once you've separated an author's claim from her evidence for that claim, your task is to identify the author's assumption. The <b>assumption</b> in an argument is any unstated fact that must be true in order for the argument to make sense. Reasoning questions come in a variety of forms. A question might ask you to simply find an assumption of an argument, while another might ask you to identify a reasoning flaw. Some Reasoning questions will have you strengthen or weaken an argument, while others test your ability to resolve a paradox. See the section "How to Approach Reasoning Questions" toward the end of this chapter for examples of different types of Reasoning questions and predictable patterns to look for.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>STEP 4 Make a prediction.</h4>
          <p>Instead, use the information in the passage to arrive at a correct answer. After you have read the passage, identified the type of question you're dealing with, and researched as appropriate, take a few seconds to imagine what the correct answer should look like. This is your prediction. Then, when you begin to read the answers, you will be able to rule out those that do not match your prediction-that do not match information in the passage-even if they seem like reasonable or relevant statements.</p>
          <h4>STEP 5 Evaluate the answer choices.</h4>
          <p>There are also predictable and repeatable types of wrong answers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Outside the Scope.</b> These answer choices misrepresent the scope of a particular part of the passage, often by drawing an irrelevant comparison to something not mentioned in the passage.</li>
            <li><b>Extreme.</b> Be careful when you see answer choices that include extreme language like <i>always, never, mostly, rarely,</i> and so on. The passage must support such strong/extreme language for the choice to be correct.</li>
            <li><b>Distortion.</b> These incorrect answer choices use specific language from the passage, but then distort the context or meaning of the details in the passage.</li>
            <li><b>180.</b> These answer choices contradict (either subtly or explicitly) the statements made in the passage.</li>
            <li><b>Half-Right/Half-Wrong.</b> These are especially common in longer answer choices, where the first clause of a long sentence is correct but then the second half goes awry.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A <b>conclusion</b> is often an opinion, a bold claim, a recommendation, a prediction, or the rebuttal of someone else's viewpoint. <b>Evidence</b> is the facts and/or opinions presented in support of the author's claim. <b>Assumption</b> is, the fact that the author believes must be true but hasn't explicitly stated. If you're having trouble spotting it, ask yourself this: Is there any new term or idea that appears in the conclusion but was nowhere to be found in the evidence?</p>
          <p>Arguments like the one in which the author moves from discussing one thing in the evidence to a different thing in the conclusion-are called <b>scope shift arguments</b>. <b>Representativeness Arguments</b> is aother common argument pattern in which the conclusion is about a different population than the evidence. lookout for any argument in which information about one group is used to draw a conclusion about a larger group or a different group. If you are asked to weaken the argument, look for an answer that indicates the group in the evidence <u>differs on a key characteristic</u> from the group in the conclusion. If you are asked to strengthen the argument, look for a statement that says the two groups are <u>similar in an important way</u>.</p>

          <h4>GET A CLUE!</h4>
          <p>The <i>text</i> of the passage provides the <i>context</i> for the correct answer. Your mission is to determine the intended meaning of the passage, based on the information in the passage. The <b>clue</b> is the information in the sentence that provides insight into the word or phrase that goes in the blank.</p>
          <h5>Who or what is the blank describing?</h5>
          <p>An <b>adjective</b> will be easiest to work with, because then the blank merely <u>describes the noun next to the blank</u>. If it's a <b>verb</b> that's missing, the blank describes <b>some action or process</b>. If it's <b>noun</b> that's missing, the blank represents <u>a person, thing, or idea-or often some aspect of another noun</u> in the passage.</p>
          <h5>What else in the passage provides insight into that person or thing?</h5>
          <p>The next order of business is to find the information in the passage that tells you something about the person or thing described by the blank. They always give you one or more pieces of information that offer insight into the topic of the blank. This information is the clue, and it's all there in the text.</p>

          <h5>Same Meaning or Direction/Agreement</h5>
          <p>accordingly also and because consequently for example furthermore hence in addition moreover next similarly since so therefore thus too ; (semicolon) : (colon)</p>

          <p><b>Transition words</b> are words such as <i>and,</i> <i>but, so, however, because, despite, since, although</i>, <i>instead,</i> etc., that indicate how ideas in the sentence relate to each other. Thus, transition words convey important information about the intended meaning of a sentence. Some transition words, such as <i>but</i> and <i>however,</i> indicate that the portion of the sentence immediately following the transition word represents the <b>opposite</b> meaning to the other idea or action in the sentence. Here are some examples of sentences employing these sort of contrast transition words. The transition words are bolded.</p>
          <p>Other transition words, such as <i>and, because</i>, and <i>since</i>, indicate that the portion of the sentence immediately following the transition word represents the <b>same</b> meaning as some other idea or action in the sentence. Here are some examples of sentences employing these sort of same direction transition words. The transition words are bolded.</p>

          <h4>PROCESS OF ELIMINATION</h4>
          <h5>Positive and Negative Words</h5>
          <p>One way to slice quickly through the lineup of answer choices is to decide whether the word in the <u>blank should have a positive or negative connotation</u> and then <u>separate the answer choices into positive ones and negative ones</u>.</p>
          <h5>Synonym / No Synonym</h5>
          <p>One strategy is to look over the answer choices for synonym pairs and choose one of these pairs for the answer. However, the warning given earlier in the chapter still holds: It is sometimes the case that the correct answer choices will not be strict synonyms while synonym pairs can be found among the incorrect answer choices! Therefore, this strategy must be used with caution and considered a last resort. It's best reserved for times when you are pretty familiar with the words in the answer choices but having difficulty with the clue.</p>

          <h4>HOW TO CONQUER ADVANCED SENTENCE EQUIVALENCE QUESTIONS</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Find the Clues and Transition words</b>.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Begin by asking "Who or what is the blank describing?" and "What else in the sentence gives insight into that person or thing?</li>
              <li>For Sentence Equivalence questions it may be difficult to identify the clue using the questions above. If that is the case, then start by determining the part of speech needed in the blank. This helps you to more concretely and efficiently answer the question, "Who or what is the blank describing?"</li>
              <li>Transitions are not always clearly marked with words such as <i>and,</i> <i>but, so, however, because, despite, since, although</i>, <i>instead</i>, etc. Be alert to other ways that a sentence can make two parts the same or opposite, agreeing or contrasting.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Come up with your own word or phrase for the blank.</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>The more thoroughly you've done Step 1, the easier it will be to come up with a word for Step 2, and the better that word will predict the correct answer choices.</li>
              <li>Do not be preoccupied with coming up with the perfect, most GRE-worthy word. Feel free to recycle from the clues in the sentence. Use a phrase instead of a single word. You do want a word or phrase that accurately reflects the clues. But your goal is not to have a scratch pad full of elegant words; it's to answer the questions quickly and correctly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Check each answer choice and use your scratch paper.</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Stick with the clues and the word you come up with. In reviewing the answer choices, if you have to choose between words you know that don't match and words you don't know, pick from the words you don't know! For example, if you have eliminated three answer choices and put question marks next to the other three, pick two from the ones that you've marked with question marks.</li>
              <li>What makes a Sentence Equivalence question harder is often just the difficulty of the words in the answer choices. Your best defense is to build a strong vocabulary. Learn your word lists, and learn the range of meanings for each word.</li>
              <li>The correct answer will not always be a pair of synonyms, and synonym pairs in the answer choices are not necessarily the correct answer.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>THE BASIC APPROACH FOR READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Attack the Passage.</b> This step will vary slightly based on the length of the passage you're dealing with, but in each case, the goal is to read less, not more.</li>
            <li><b>Size Up the Questions.</b> Reading Comprehension questions on the GRE can ask you to do a variety of things. Make sure you know what the question's asking you to do.</li>
            <li><b>Find and Paraphrase the Answer.</b> This is the key. Always return to the passage to find your answer; never answer questions from memory!</li>
            <li><b>Use Process of Elimination.</b> You can use a number of helpful POE guidelines on Reading Comprehension questions. We'll go over these in detail in a moment.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>ATTACK THE PASSAGE</h4>
          <p>Fortunately, you know most of this already. The truth is that all GRE passages are really about one of two things: a problem or a change.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Problem</b> passages cover these questions:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>What is the problem?</li>
              <li>What caused the problem?</li>
              <li>What are the effects of the problem?</li>
              <li>Are there any solutions?</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Change</b> passages cover these questions:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>What was the old way?</li>
              <li>What is the new way?</li>
              <li>What caused the change?</li>
              <li>What are the effects of the change?</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h5>Purpose</h5>
            <p>The purpose of a paragraph, passage, or even an individual sentence is to <b>Predict</b>, <b>Recommend</b>, <b>Inform</b>, <b>Correct</b>, or <b>Evaluate</b>.</p>
            <p>Most passages or paragraphs simply inform. Whenever an author begins to offer an opinion, however, he or she may be <b>evaluating an argument</b>, <b>correcting a misperception</b>, <b>predicting an outcome</b>, or even <b>recommending a behavior</b>.</p>
            <p>With longer passages, it is helpful to go paragraph by paragraph and note the subject and the purpose of each paragraph.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>SIZE UP THE QUESTIONS</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Fetch Question</h5>
            <p>Fetch, or retrieval, questions ask, in one form or another, "What does the passage say?" They are the most straightforward of reading questions, and simply require you to return to the passage and retrieve information. To answer a retrieval question, use the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Read the Question.</b> What kind of question are you dealing with?</li>
              <li><b>Make the Question Back into a Question.</b> Often the questions aren't questions at all; they're really incomplete sentences. To find an answer, you must first have a question.</li>
              <li><b>Find Proof.</b> This is the golden rule of reading comprehension. You will always be able to prove the correct answer with something in the passage. If you cannot put your finger on a specific word, phrase, or sentence that proves your answer choice, you can't pick it. To help find answers in the passage, use one or both of the following techniques:</li>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Five Up/Five Down.</b> You can't trust ETS to put the correct answer exactly where they say it will be. If they highlight a portion of the passage, start reading five lines above and read until five lines below the highlighted passage. This way, you are always looking at things <i>in context.</i></li>
                <li><b>Lead Word.</b> A lead word is any word in the question that will be easy to skim for in the passage. Names, numbers, dates, large technical terms all make good lead words. Of course, once you find your lead word, read five lines up and five lines down (for a vocab-in-context question, you need to read only three lines up and three lines down).</li>
              </ol>
              <li><b>Link the Info in the Passage to the Question Task.</b> Once you find the relevant information in the passage take a moment to make sure that it addresses the question task. Is this all the author said? Are there other details that you need to consider?</li>
              <li><b>Use Process of Elimination.</b></li>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Avoid Extreme Statements.</b> No matter what the passage says, ETS can phrase a correct answer any way they like. They want correct answers that are difficult to argue with. That means <i>wishy-washy</i> language (often, many, usually). <i>Extreme</i> language (is, all, every, always) is too easy to prove wrong, so it almost always is incorrect.</li>
                <li><b>Recycled Language.</b> ETS knows that most test-takers spend too long reading the passage. Then, they try to answer the questions by memory. So, ETS creates a lot of wrong answers by simply recycling memorable words and phrases back into the answer choices. These answers are very appealing because you'll remember reading something like that. But, the correct answer is usually a paraphrase of the information in the passage. Just remember that the more that an answer sounds like it is word for word from the passage, the less likely it is to be right. So be suspicious of answers that make you say "Wait! I remember reading that!"</li>
                <li><b>Half Right = All Wrong.</b> ETS likes to write answer choices that are half right; which also means they're half-and thus all-wrong. The first part of the answer choice will usually look good, but the second part will be incorrect. Make sure to read the entire choice carefully.</li>
                <li><b>Bad Comparisons.</b> Be suspicious of answers that contain comparison words such as <i>more...than, less...than, greater, faster, compared to,</i> etc. In most cases, the items in the answer choice are mentioned in the passage but they aren't compared in the passage. So, always be wary of answers that make comparisons. If you can't find the comparison in the passage, cross the answer off.</li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Reasoning Question</h5>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Figure Out What the Question Wants</b>. Reasoning questions never ask for a simple fact from the passage. Instead, you'll need to figure out what type of information the question requires before you go back to the passage. For example, some reasoning questions may ask why an author brings up an example. Why do authors ever bring up examples? Well, to support a point that they either just made or are about to make. So, you need to find the point that the author uses the example to support.</li>
              <li><b>Return to the Passage</b>. You'll still need to return to the passage to find the answer. In general, reasoning questions will require you to read more of the passage than simple fetch questions because often you'll need to know the context for a particular piece of information.</li>
              <li><b>Answer in Your Own Words If Possible</b>. You'll be able to complete this step for some reasoning questions, but not for others. If you can't answer in your words, go right to the answers and use POE.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>USE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Avoid Extreme Statements.</b> ETS prefers wishy-washy statements to extreme ones. When in doubt, pick the answer that has a weaker tone.</li>
            <li><b>Half Right = All Wrong.</b> ETS likes to write answer choices that are half right; which also means that they're half-and thus all-wrong. The first part of the answer choice will usually look good, but the second part will be incorrect. Make sure to read the entire choice carefully.</li>
            <li><b>Recycled Language.</b> Some wrong answer choices just take parts of the passage and garble them. These answers usually contain information that's taken directly from the passage rather than paraphrasing it. Eliminate them!</li>
            <li><b>Beyond the Information Given.</b> These answers go too far beyond what is written in the passage. If you can't point to a part of the passage that matches information in the answer choice, that choice is probably wrong.</li>
          </ol>
          <section>
            <h5>Avoid Extreme Statements</h5>
            <p>Extreme statements are answer choices that make absolute claims. There are very few absolutes in the world, so you shouldn't expect ETS reading passages (which are all excerpted or based on actual academic papers) to contain extreme statements.</p>
            <p>Certain words make choices extreme and, therefore, easy to dispute. Here are a few of these words. <b>must</b>, <b>the first</b>, <b>each</b>, <b>every</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>the best</b>, <b>only</b>, <b>totally</b>, <b>always</b>, <b>no</b></p>
            <p>You shouldn't automatically eliminate a choice that contains one of these words, but you should turn your attention to it immediately and attack it vigorously. If you can find even one exception, you can eliminate that choice.</p>
            <p>Other words make choices moderate, more mushy, and therefore hard to dispute. Here are a few of these words. <b>may</b>, <b>can</b>, <b>some</b>, <b>many</b>, <b>sometimes</b>, <b>often</b></p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Half Right = All Wrong</h5>
            <p>Careful reading of the answer choices is essential on Reading Comprehension questions. Remember that your job is to find flaws in answer choices and eliminate them. Many people focus on what they like about an answer, rather than what's wrong with it. ETS loves to write answer choices that start out fine, but then say something wrong. Don't be taken in by the part of the answer you like. Use a critical eye when applying POE; don't look for reasons to keep disputed answer choices, look for reasons to eliminate them. One word can make an answer choice wrong if that word isn't supported by the passage.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Recycled Language</h5>
            <p>One of ETS's favorite tricks is to write answer choices that contain information from different parts of the passage than the one to which the question refers. If you aren't being careful, you'll think, "I remember something like that from the passage" and pick the wrong answer choice. This is one reason it's so important to use lead words and line references to guide you to the right part of the passage. Never answer a question from memory.</p>
            <p>ETS also likes to conflate different parts of a passage to create an answer that uses a lot of words from the passage, but doesn't say a whole lot. For example, use the passage from the previous section to answer the following question.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Beyond the Information Given</h5>
            <p>ETS takes its reading passages from textbooks, collections of essays, works of scholarship, and other sources of serious reading matter. However, be careful not to answer questions based on the fact that you did your undergraduate thesis on the topic, or that you once read a newspaper article about the topic at hand. The answers are in the passage; don't use outside knowledge.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>UNDERSTANDING STRUCTURE</h4>
          <p>First, pay attention to the structure of each paragraph. The most important information is probably going to be found at <b>the beginning and end of the paragraph</b>. Good authors know this and make sure to put key points where they are likely to stand out. So, focus on the beginning and end of each paragraph.</p>
          <p>Second, look for transition words. Writers use these words as signposts to direct your reading. When you see same-direction transitions such as <i>for example</i>, <i>in addition</i>, <i>and</i>, or <i>furthermore</i>, you know the author is going to be supporting an earlier statement. If you already understand the point of the paragraph, feel free to skim through these lines. However, <b>change-direction transitions</b> like <i>although</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>yet</i>, and <i>however</i>, <b>signify an important shift</b>. Writers use words like this to direct the reader's attention to an important change or revelation in the progression of ideas.</p>
          <p>Finally, the conclusion of the piece offers the author one last chance to get his or her point across. Always read the last paragraph. Does the piece wrap things up nicely or is there some doubt? Does the author suggest further avenues of inquiry? The way the passage ends can help you to understand the author's main point or primary purpose in writing the passage.</p>

        <h3>Critical Reasoning</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>BREAKING AN ARGUMENT DOWN</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Identifying the Conclusion</h5>
            <p>The conclusion of an argument is generally a statement of opinion-it's the author's belief or prediction about a situation.</p>
            <p>For example, often you can identify the conclusion by certain key words. Specifically, keep an eye out for the following: <b><i>therefore, thus, consequently, and so, in conclusion</i></b></p>
            <p>You should also look for any words that indicate an opinion, such as the following: <b><i>suggest, believe, hope, indicate, argue, follow</i></b></p>
            <p>In addition, a conclusion is often a belief about what should or might happen. Look for the following: <b><i>should, would, must, will</i></b></p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Finding the Premise</h5>
            <p>After you identify the conclusion of an argument, your next task is to find the argument's premise. The premise is the evidence that the author gives in support of the conclusion.</p>
            <p>Critical Reasoning passages are usually based on statistics, surveys, polls, or reports and all of these things are premises-in fact, these are the most common types of premises.</p>
            <p>Finally, just like conclusions, premises have certain indicator words: <i>because, due to, since, based on</i></p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>CRACKING CRITICAL REASONING QUESTIONS</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Basic Approach</h5>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Read the Question Carefully</b>. Don't dive into the passage without being aware of exactly what you're dealing with-start by making sure that it really is critical reasoning and not a plain old reading comprehension passage.</li>
              <li><b>Analyze the Argument</b>. Identify the premise, conclusion, and assumption of the argument.</li>
              <li><b>Know What the Answer Needs to Do.</b> For each type of question, you can know what characteristic the right answer needs. For example, a Weaken question attacks the assumption of the argument.</li>
              <li><b>Use Process of Elimination</b>. Process of Elimination (POE) is a valuable tool. If you're not sure what the correct answer is, look for the wrong answers instead; eliminate them, and even if you still can't identify the correct answer, you have a much greater chance of guessing the correct answer.
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Give New Information</b>. The assumption must link the premise and the conclusion. Any answer choices that discuss information that is not part of the original argument are wrong.</p>
                  <li><b>Have the Wrong Tone</b>. The tone of the answer choice should match the tone of the argument. Arguments that have very strong conclusions require very strongly worded answer choices, and arguments that have milder tones require milder answer choices.</p>
                  <li><b>Weaken the Argument</b>. The assumption is necessary to the argument. Eliminate any answer choice that would weaken or hurt the argument-unless of course you're dealing with a Weaken question!</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Strengthen Questions</h5>
            <p>Strengthen questions will ask you to make the argument stronger. You'll be asked to do this by identifying answer choices that will support the assumption. Strengthen questions are often phrased as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?</li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, would most support the author's argument?</li>
              <li>Supporters of the argument would most likely cite which of following pieces of additional evidence?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you're using POE on Strengthen questions, always eliminate answer choices that</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Are Only Half Good</b>. Some answers will be on the right track, but they won't strengthen the argument enough. Again, remember that you're looking for the <i>correct</i> answer, not an answer that might be good enough. You shouldn't have to make any assumptions about the answer choice in order for it to strengthen the argument.</p>
              <li><b>Weaken the Argument</b>. Typically, one of the answer choices will weaken the argument. Unless your task is to weaken the argument, you can easily eliminate it.</p>
              <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Some answer choices do nothing to the argument; they neither strengthen nor weaken it. Get rid of these; they're decoys.</p>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Weaken Questions</h5>
            <p>As we've learned, the assumption is what makes an argument work. It follows, then, that if you attack the assumption, you will weaken the argument. You can identify Weaken questions by looking for the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument?</li>
              <li>Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the argument above?</li>
              <li>Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the author's argument?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The guidelines for Weaken questions are basically the same as those for Strengthen questions. Eliminate any answer choices that</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Are Half Good</b>. Make sure the answer attacks the assumption thoroughly.</li>
              <li><b>Strengthen the Argument</b>. Once again, one answer usually does the opposite of the question task-eliminate the odd man out.</li>
              <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Some answer choices neither strengthen nor weaken the argument: Eliminate them.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Inference Questions</h5>
            <p>An inference is a conclusion that's based on a set of given facts. You can identify Inference questions because they'll look a lot like the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?</li>
              <li>Which of the following statements can be properly inferred from the information above?</li>
              <li>Based on the information above, which of the following can logically be concluded?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On Inference questions, eliminate answer choices that</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Go Beyond the Information</b>. Stick to the facts on inference questions. Avoid answers that are overly broad or general.</li>
              <li><b><i>Could</i></b> <b>Be True</b>. The correct answer on an inference <i>must</i> be true. Answers that might be true or could be true are no good.</li>
              <li><b>Use Extreme Language</b>. Be suspicious of strong language. The presence of words such as <i>all, none, always, never,</i> or <i>impossible</i> often means that an answer choice is wrong.</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

            <h5>Resolve/Explain</h5>
            <p>Some Critical Reasoning questions will present you with a paradox-a set of facts that seem to contradict each other. On these questions, your task is to find the answer choice that best explains the contradiction. You can recognize these questions because they often contain the following phrases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which of the following choices would best explain the situation presented above?</li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, would best resolve the discrepancy above?</li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, best reconciles the seeming paradox above?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On Resolve/Explain questions, you should eliminate answer choices that</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Do Nothing</b>. Many wrong answers simply do nothing to the paradox.</li>
              <li><b>Are Only Half Right</b>. Some answers will deal with only half of the conflict. Make sure the answer you select addresses both facts.</li>
              <li><b>Worsen the Situation</b>. Eliminate choices that appear to make the situation worse.</li>

            <li><b>Read only the sentence.</b></li>
            <li><b>Write down your own fill-in, using proof from the sentence.</b> Come up with your <i>own</i> word or words to go in the blank. The proof is what forces the contents of the blank to be perfectly predictable. In other words, the proof solves the mystery of the blank. We sometimes use the term <i>clue</i> or <i>evidence</i> to talk about things in the sentence that point to the blank. That's all well and good. But the term <i>proof</i> really captures the idea that stuff elsewhere in the sentence <i>rigorously determines</i> the contents of the blank. That all depends on little <i>signal words</i>. These signal words are also part of the proof. They provide logical connections between ideas.</li>

            <h6>Look for the Simple Story</h6>
            <p>Every GRE passage has a <b>simple story-the gist or core meaning of the passage</b>. You must find this simple story on the first read-through.</p>
            <p>How do you identify this simple story? For now, do not worry about whether, or how, you write down the simple story as you read a passage. Just focus on finding that story. Here are three different methods:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Text it to me.</b> As you read, ask yourself this question: Can you give him or her just 5-10 words to describe a paragraph? You will find yourself cutting out the trivia. Simplifying does not contradict the principle of being engaged with the content of the passage. You should be extremely interested in the passage so you know what is important.</li>
              <li><b>Make a table of contents.</b> Alternatively, you can create a short table of contents. Use five words or fewer for the headline of each paragraph. As written, these headlines may not sound exactly like a story, but they outline the same narrative.</li>
              <li><b>Look for content and judgment.</b> The parts of a simple story can generally be classified as Content or Judgment, as follows:
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Content: the scientific, historical, or artistic subject matter of the passage</b></p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Causes (effects, evidence, logical results)</li>
                      <li>Processes (steps, means, ends)</li>
                      <li>Categories (examples, generalities)</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Judgment: what the author and any other people believe about the Content</b></p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Theories and hypotheses</li>
                      <li>Evaluations and opinions</li>
                      <li>Comparisons and contrasts</li>
                      <li>Advantages and disadvantages</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Reminder: Don't forget the twist.</b> Even as you look for the simple story, realize that, on the GRE, there will often be some important <i>qualification</i> or <i>contrast</i>-a <b>key twist</b> or two in the road. A qualification is a restriction or a limiting factor. After all, such twists help the GRE ask difficult questions. Be ready to incorporate a key twist or even two in your simple story.</p>

            <h6>Link to What You Already Know</h6>
            <p>When you read words on a page, they typically activate preexisting knowledge in your head. This is a crucial part of comprehending what you are reading. Every word that you know in the English language is naturally tied to a web of memories and ideas.</p>
            <p>In this case, try making the story real. That is, <b>actively <i>imagine</i> what the words are referring to</b>. Re-explain the original text to yourself. Visualize what it represents. Indulge in simplifications, even stereotypes. Make up examples, and use any other mental handles that you can.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h6>Unpack the Beginning</h6>
            <p>Academic language is often dense, with long noun phrases formed out of simple sentences. <b>To unpack an academic-style sentence, turn it into a few simple sentences</b> that express essentially the same meaning.</p>
            <p>In general, you should <i>not</i> write this unpacking out (except as an exercise) or apply it throughout the passage. Like making the story real, unpacking is a powerful tool to smash open resistant language, especially at the start of the passage. Use this technique judiciously.</p>
            <p>The steps to unpacking a complex sentence are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Grab a concrete noun first.</b> Pick something that you can touch and that causes other things to happen. Do not necessarily pick something at the start of the sentence.</li>
              <li><b>Turn actions back into verbs.</b> In academic language, verbs are often made into noun or adjective phrases. Re-create the verbs. Also, feel free to start with <i>There is</i> or <i>There was</i>.</li>
              <li><b>Put only <i>one</i> simple thought in a sentence.</b></li>
              <li><b>Link each subsequent sentence to the previous one, using</b> <b><i>this or these</i>.</b> For instance, <i>This resulted in ...</i> This process mimics speech, which is usually easy to understand.</li>
              <li><b>Simplify or "quote off" details.</b> If a jargon word is used in an important way, put quotes around it. Think to yourself, "<i>Whatever that means</i> ..." and keep going. If the term is necessary, you will figure it out from context later. For instance, the term <i>"diachronic"</i> needs a pair of quotes so that you do not focus on it. You might even think of it just as "<i>d</i>-something."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Again, it is often not practical to employ such an elaborate process in real time on the GRE. However, knowing how to break down a complex sentence into its component ideas can help you read more efficiently in general. In addition, you can use this technique if you are stuck on one of the early sentences, although it will require some effort.</p>

            <h6>Pay Attention to Signals</h6>

          <h5>Components of Passages</h5>
          <section>
            <h6>The Point</h6>
            <p>The Point is <b>the most important message of the passage</b>. In other words, the author has written the passage in order to convey the Point. How does the Point relate to the simple story of the passage? Very simply, <b>the Point is the crux of the simple story</b>. After all, the Point is the most important message that the author wants to convey. You can also relate the Point to the Content/Judgment framework. The Point contains the most important Judgment made by the author about the central Content of the passage.</p>
            <p>Where is the Point in the passage? It can be almost anywhere. The way to find the Point is to ask, "What is the most important message that the author is trying to convey in this passage?" Occasionally, the Point is at the very beginning of the passage; often, the first paragraph sets up a situation and the <i>second</i> paragraph contains a twist that constitutes the Point.</p>
            <p>The Point may be any kind of important message, but across sample passages, there are a few common varieties that sometimes overlap:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Resolution:</b> resolves an issue or a problem<br /></li>
              <li><b>Answer:</b> answers a question (similar to Resolution)<br /></li>
              <li><b>New Idea:</b> describes a surprising new idea, theory, or research result<br /></li>
              <li><b>Reason:</b> explains an observation<br /></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notice that <b>the Point is related to a passage's purpose</b>. The point is what the author wants to <i>convey</i>. The purpose of a passage is generally to convey that Point. However, the purpose can often be described more broadly or abstractly as well.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h6>Background, Support, and Implications</h6>
            <p><b>The Background is information you need to understand the Point.</b> The context and the basic facts about the topic are given in the Background. This component may be brief.</p>
            <p><b>The Support consists of assertions and opinions <i>for</i> the Point.</b> The Support might include concessions to the other side of the argument. This component is always present and often constitutes a substantial portion of the passage.</p>
            <p><b>The Implications result from the Point</b>. In other words, the author now assumes that you are convinced of the Point and so begins to enumerate the consequences. Implications are not always present, but when they are, they tend to be important.</p>
            <p>You should understand what you are reading in terms of the four components:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Is this the main message? If so, this is the Point.</li>
              <li>Is this just background information? If so, this is Background.</li>
              <li>Is this supporting evidence for the main message? If so, this is Support.</li>
              <li>Is this an implication of the main message? If so, this is an Implication.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Some part of the Background or the Support may also function as foreshadowing. <b>Foreshadowing sets up the Point.</b> It often does so by standing in contrast to the Point:</p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Foreshadowing</th>
                  <th></th>
                  <th>Point</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Problem..........</td>
                  <td>leads to..........</td>
                  <td>Resolution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Question..........</td>
                  <td>leads to..........</td>
                  <td>Answer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Old Idea..........</td>
                  <td>leads to..........</td>
                  <td>New Idea</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Observation..........</td>
                  <td>leads to..........</td>
                  <td>Reason or New Idea</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><b>Foreshadowing is not always present.</b> Do not rely on foreshadowing to identify the Point. However, if foreshadowing is present, it can help you to find the Point more quickly and easily.</p>

          <h5>Using your Notes</h5>
          <p>To create your notes as quickly as possible, consider the following notations: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Abbreviate long terms, particularly proper nouns. </li>
            <li>Use arrows (e.g., <b>--></b>) to indicate cause-effect relationships or changes over time. </li>
            <li>If a passage contains speakers, writers, points of view, arguments, and so on, keep them organized by placing the person with the opinion before a given opinion with a colon..</li>
            <li>If you write down examples, mark them with parentheses or "Ex.".</li>
            <li>Number each paragraph. Paragraph breaks are important to remember.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The note-taking process is largely the same for long passages as for short ones, except that you will pay a bit more attention to the first paragraph of a long passage. The note-taking process serves two main purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It provides a general structure and overall understanding without getting you bogged down in details.</li>
            <li>It promotes an efficient first reading that still gives you enough time to answer questions.</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>You should be able to answer all <i>General</i> questions without referring either to your notes or to the passage. General questions pertain to the passage's main idea, its purpose, or its structure overall. </li>
            <li>As for <i>Specific</i> questions, you will have to return to the passage to find particular details. Do not depend on your memory, as the GRE knows how to take advantage of this. <i>Prove</i> your answer in the text. In many cases, you will be able to find the relevant details on your own. But you can also use your Headline Notes as a search tool to help you know which paragraph to check.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To determine how much time to spend on a passage, use this as a rule: <b>you have about 1.5 minutes per Reading Comprehension question, total</b>. The total number of minutes includes time for reading the passage, creating notes, and answering all the questions.</p>
          <p>Out of this reading comprehension period, you should spend approximately half of the time to reading the passage and generating your notes. Then you should spend an average of 45 seconds actually answering each question. You should try to answer General questions in about 45 seconds. Specific questions will be more time-consuming, because they demand that you review the text of the passage. You should allocate up to 60 seconds for any Specific question.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h5>Heading Notes</h5>
          <p><b>When you encounter a passage, create a Headline Notes of the passage during your first reading.</b> A Headline Notes serves two main purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It provides a general structure and overall understanding without getting you bogged down in details.</li>
            <li>It promotes a fast first reading of a passage that still gives you enough time to answer questions.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To create a Headline Notes, follow these steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>The first paragraph of a long passage sets the basic context and gives shape to the text.</b> As such, you'll start out reading more slowly and carefully. Unlike most short passages, long passages often have a first paragraph that is substantially more important than the other paragraphs, setting the tone and (typically) describing what the rest of the passage will be about. As a result, take a little more time to summarize the first paragraph, making sure that you thoroughly understand the main idea as well as any big surprises or contrasting ideas.</li>
            <li><b>Your Headline Notes should summarize or indicate the main idea of each paragraph</b>. Most paragraphs have one topic sentence. Generally, the topic sentence is the first or second sentence, although it can also be a combination of the two. Read the first sentence or two of the first paragraph. Identify the topic sentence and summarize it concisely on your scratch paper in the form of a headline. If you cannot identify a topic sentence, then your headline should summarize the main idea or purpose of the paragraph in your own words.</li>
            <li><b>Read the rest of the paragraph with an eye for big surprises and results.</b> As you read the rest of the paragraph, briefly summarize anything else that is very important or surprising in the paragraph. Often, this will consist of jotting down just a word or two.</li>
            <li><b>If there is a second paragraph, follow the same process.</b> Each paragraph may introduce a whole new idea. Therefore, your approach to any second paragraph should be the same as with the first paragraph. As you create your Headline Notes, relate the headlines to each other. If the passage is really tough, slow down and go sentence by sentence. If the passage is easier and you think you are getting it, read more (even a whole paragraph) before taking notes on that chunk. At the same time, you should force yourself to stop periodically and consider adding to your Headline Notes.</li>
            <li><b>Once you have finished the passage, identify the passage's Point</b>.After you have finished reading the passage and creating the Headline Notes, make sure you know what the Point of the passage is. If it is not in your Headline Notes already, be sure to add it. Then label or mark the Point so that you articulate it to yourself. Now proceed to the first question.</li>

          <h5>Strategies for RC Questions</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><b>General Questions: If you are stuck between two answer choices, use a scoring system to assign a value to each one.</b> You should be able to answer General questions without having to reread the entire passage. An incorrect answer choice may pertain only to a detail in a body paragraph. As you reread, you might spot that attractive detail and choose the wrong answer. So, instead of rereading, first articulate the point to yourself in your own words. Then <b>dive right into the answer choices and start eliminating</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Questions: Identify the key words in the question. Then, go back to the passage and find those key words.</b> You <i>will</i> need to reread and grasp details in the passage to answer Specific questions. First, read the question and focus on the key words you are most likely to find in the passage. Sometimes you will need to find a synonym for the key words in the question. Then, look back over the passage to find those key words. Use your notes as a search tool, if necessary. Do <i>not</i> look at the answer choices. Four out of five of them are meant to mislead you.</li>
            <li><b>Specific Questions: Find one or two <i>proof sentences</i> to defend the correct answer choice. Boil them down into your mantra.</b> Once you find the key words, reread the surrounding sentence or sentences to answer the question. In fact, do not look at the answer choices until you <b>boil down the relevant sentence or sentences into a mantra</b>-five words of truth. Then you can bring back that mantra and hold it in your head as you scan the five answer choices, eliminating the four lies and matching your mantra to the truth.</li>
            <li><b>Justify every word in the answer choice.</b> In the correct answer choice, <b>every word must be completely true</b> and within the scope of the passage. If you cannot justify <i>every</i> word in the answer choice, eliminate it.</li>
            <li><b>Justify extreme words.</b> Extreme words, such as <i>all</i> and <i>never</i>, tend to broaden the scope of an answer choice too much or make it too extreme. <b>The GRE prefers moderate language and ideas.</b> Eliminate answer choices that go too far. Of course, occasionally you are justified in picking an extreme choice, but the passage must back you up 100 percent.</li>
            <li><b>Infer as little as possible.</b> Many Reading Comprehension questions ask you to infer something from the passage. An inference is an informed deduction. Reading Comprehension inferences rarely go far beyond what is stated in the passage. In general, you should infer so little that the inference seems obvious. It is often surprising how simplistic GRE inferences are. If an answer choice answers the question and can be confirmed by language in the passage, it will be the correct one. Conversely, you should eliminate answer choices that require any logical stretch or leap.<b>You must be able to prove the answer, just as if the question asked you to look it up in the &#173;passage.</b></li>
            <li><b>Preview the question.</b> Quickly click through to see how many questions are associated with the passage, and then go back to the first question. Before reading the passage, read the first question. Previewing the first question will give you a good sense for what you can expect in the passage. To review: first check the number of questions associated with the passage, then preview the first question, then read the passage.</li>

          <h5>Question Type Analysis</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Main Idea</b>: <p>This asks you about the main idea of the passage. This question type is always General. Remember that you'll know the main idea from your initial read-through. <b>Typical wordings:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The author is primarily concerned with ... ?</li>
                  <li>Which of the following best states the author's main point?</li>
                  <li>Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Lookup Detail</b>: <p>This asks you for a detail that you can look up right in the passage. This question type is always Specific. Notice that Lookup Detail questions can be made harder with EXCEPT. With an EXCEPT variation, you have to find the one answer that <i>isn't</i> true. <b>Typical wordings:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>According to the passage, X resulted primarily from which of the following ... ?</li>
                  <li>According to the passage, as the process of X continues, all of the following may occur EXCEPT ... </li>
                  <li>According to the passage, person X indicates that all of the following were true of Y EXCEPT ... </li>
                  <li>The author provides information that would answer which of the following questions?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Infer about Facts</b>: <p>This asks you to make a clear, unshakeable deduction about facts presented in the passage. This question type is always Specific. Occasionally, you will need to make an inference connecting two parts of the passage. Regardless, you must not make any new assumptions or draw on knowledge from outside the passage. <b>Typical wordings:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>It can be inferred from the passage that slower X than those discussed in the passage ...</li>
                  <li>The author implies that a major element of X is ...</li>
                  <li>Which of the following statements concerning X is most directly suggested in the passage?</li>
                  <li>The quality of X described in lines 10-15 is most clearly an example of ...</li>
                  <li>The passage supports which of the following statements about X?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Infer about Opinions</b>: <p>This asks you to make a clear, unshakeable deduction about an opinion or attitude. This opinion or attitude may be of someone referred to in the passage, or it may be of the author himself or herself. This question type is usually Specific, but occasionally it might be General. <b>Typical wordings:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The author's attitude toward X, as discussed in the passage, is best described as ... [answer choices are adjectives]</li>
                  <li>In the first paragraph of the passage, the author's attitude toward X can best be described as ...</li>
                  <li>It can be inferred from the passage that person X chose Y because X believed that ...</li>
                  <li>It can be inferred from the passage that the author believes which of the following about X?</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Author's Purpose</b>: <p>This asks you <i>why</i> or <i>for what purpose</i> the author has written something or constructed the passage in a certain way. These questions address the role, structure, and function of particular words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and even the passage as a whole. In the last case, the question would be General, but usually this question type is Specific. <b>Typical wordings:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The author refers to X (line 45) primarily in order to ...</li>
                  <li>Which of the following phrases best expresses the sense of word X as it is used in lines 20-21 of the passage?</li>
                </ul>

          <h5>Types of Wrong Answer Choices</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Out of Scope</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Introduces an unwarranted assertion</b> supported nowhere in the passage.</li>
                <li>Might be "real-world plausible." That is, the answer might be true or seem to be true in the real world. However, if the answer is not supported in the passage, it is out of scope.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Direct Contradiction</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>States the exact opposite</b> of something asserted in the passage.</li>
                <li>Paradoxically attractive, because it relates to the passage closely. If you miss one contrast or switchback in the trail, you can easily think a direct contradiction is the right answer. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Mix-Up</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Scrambles together different words or phrases</b> from the passage, but the meaning of the choice does not reflect what the passage said.</li>
                <li>Tries to trap the student who simply matches language, not meaning.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>One Word Wrong</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Just one word (or maybe two) is incorrect.</b> Includes extreme words.</li>
                <li>More prevalent in General questions.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>True but Irrelevant</b>
              <ul>
                <li><b>True according to the passage, but does not answer the given question.</b></li>
                <li>May be too narrow or simply unrelated.</li>

        <h3>Argument Structure Passage</h3>
        <section>
          <h4>Identifying the Parts of an Argument</h4>
          <p><b>Conclusion</b>, the main point of the argument, is logically supported by the premises (and assumptions). Conclusions are in the form of an opinion or a claim; they are not pure facts. Most arguments contain conclusions, but not all of them do.</p>
          <p><b>Premises</b> provide support for the argument's conclusion. They may be facts, opinions, or claims. If they are opinions or claims, they will not be the overall claim the author is making; rather, they will be some intermediate claim the author is using to support the overall claim (conclusion).</p>
          <p><b>Counter premises</b> undermine or go against the conclusion. Occasionally, an argument will present both sides of an argument, with evidence to support both. The passage will still come down one way or the other in terms of an overall conclusion, but some of the provided evidence will be used as premises and some as counter premises (supporting a kind of counter conclusion).</p>
          <p><b>Assumptions</b> are unstated pieces of information that the argument requires to function. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Recognizing Argument Structure Passages</h4>
          <p>You can distinguish between RC questions and ASP questions. The following question types appear only on ASPs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Analyze Argument Structure</b>: These questions will highlight a sentence or two in the passage, and then ask you what purpose they're serving in the argument. Generally, when you see the word <i>argument</i>, you should think ASP.</li>
            <li><b>Strengthen/Weaken</b>: If a passage asks you to strengthen (support) or weaken (undermine) the argument, it's an ASP.</li>
            <li><b>Resolve a Paradox/Explain a Discrepancy</b>: If the question asks you to resolve or explain something puzzling, then you've got an ASP.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These question types appear only on RC passages: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Main Idea, Tone, and Attitude</b>: ASPs are generally too short to get across any kind of overall main point or tone.</li>
            <li><b>Look-Up Detail</b>: Any question that begins "According to the passage" or asks what the author talked about in detail signals a regular RC passage.</li>
            <li><b>Author's Purpose</b>: Some questions ask why the author mentioned a particular detail. If you see the language "in order to" in the question stem, then you know you've got a regular RC passage.</li>
            <li><b>Select-in-Passage or Select-One-or-More questions</b> always signal a regular RC passage. ASP questions always ask you to choose exactly one answer choice from a listed set of five answers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Inference</b>: This question type can appear on both RC passages and ASPs. The solution process for Inference is the same regardless of the type of passage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Four-Step Process</h4>
          <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
          <p>The vast majority of question stems will allow you to categorize a question, which will direct everything else you do. However, if the question stem is not immediately helpful or the question type is difficult to identify, do not dwell on the issue. Go ahead to the next step; afterward, you can reexamine the question. </p>
          <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
          <p>The question type will help you anticipate what to expect from the argument. For example, some types do have conclusions and others don't; after you've identified the question type, you'll know whether to look for a conclusion when reading the argument. You'll also take light notes during this stage.</p>
          <p><b>Step 3: State the Goal</b></p>
          <p>You'll have a particular goal that you're trying to accomplish for each question type. For example, on Strengthen questions, the goal is to find the answer that makes the conclusion at least a little more likely to be true or valid. This step only takes about 3-5 seconds, but don't skip it! Make sure that you have a clear idea of your goal before you move to the final step. </p>
          <p><b>Step 4: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
          <p>As on any RC question, process of elimination rules the day. As a general rule, cross definite wrong answers off first and then compare any remaining tempting answers. Certain question types have common traps in the wrong answers; it's important to be familiar with those before test day.</p>

          <h4>Taking Notes</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Option 1: Stream-of-Consciousness Notes</h5>
            <p>This option tends to work for people who prefer to jot down notes as they read. Read the first sentence (or enough of the first sentence to come up with a big idea). Then, jot down a (heavily abbreviated!) note and move on to the next sentence. At times, you may decide not to jot down a particular detail (e.g., background information may not be necessary to write down). Each new idea gets its own line.</p>
            <p>When you're done, determine the conclusion (if applicable-not all arguments have conclusions). Place a C next to it (it's also a good idea to put a circle around the C). Put + (plus) signs next to any premises that support that conclusion. Put - (minus) signs next to any counter premises that go against the conclusion.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Option 2: The T-Diagram</h5>
            <p>This option tends to work for people who prefer to read the entire argument first and then jot down notes.</p>
            <p><b>First, draw a large T on your scratch paper.</b> Make it asymmetrical, leaving more room on the left side, which will be the "pro" side. In most arguments, you will have very little on the "con" side (to the right). </p>
            <p><b>Second, read the argument and look for the conclusion.</b> Once you find the conclusion, <b>write it above the top line of the T</b>, abbreviating heavily. </p>
            <p><b>Third, add the rest of the argument information to the diagram.</b> Write anything that supports the conclusion on the left side of the T ("pro" or "premise"), and write anything that goes against the conclusion on the right side of the T ("con" or "counter premise").</p>
            <p>Finally, if you happened to think of any assumptions while reading, place them in brackets somewhere below the T. Make sure you can differentiate between information stated in the argument and your own thoughts when looking at your notes.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Strategies for All Question Types</h4>
          <p><b>Boundary Words in the Argument</b></p>
          <p>For any question, it is helpful to focus your attention on the <b>boundary</b> words and phrases provided in the argument. These words and phrases narrow the scope of a premise. Therefore, in your diagram, be sure to include boundary words and underline them or capitalize them for emphasis.</p>
          <p><b>Extreme Words in the Argument</b></p>
          <p>Another general strategy for all ASP questions involves <b>extreme</b> words and phrases in the body of the argument. Extreme words, such as <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>, <i>all</i>, and <i>none</i>, are the opposite of boundary words-they make the argument very broad or far-reaching. Using extreme words opens up an argument unreasonably, making it very susceptible to strengthening or weakening.</p>
          <p><b>Boundary Words in the Answer Choices</b></p>
          <p>A correct answer choice must be 100 percent correct. When you see boundary words in an answer choice, ask yourself, "What is the most extreme example I can think of that would still fit the wording of this answer choice?" Then, using the conclusion and the question asked, see whether your extreme example allows you to eliminate that answer choice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Question Types</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Strengthen the Conclusion</h5>
            <p>On Strengthen questions, your goal is to find an answer that makes the conclusion a little more likely to be valid. The conclusion likely won't be made perfect-just somewhat better than it was before.</p>
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
            <p>Strengthen the Conclusion questions ask you to provide additional support for a given conclusion. The question stem may appear in a number of forms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above? </li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the scientists' hypothesis? </li>
              <li>Which of the following provides the strongest reason to expect that the plan will be successful?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
            <p>Strengthen arguments will always contain conclusions; because your task is to strengthen the conclusion, your first task is to find that conclusion. Also take note of the premises offered to support the conclusion and think about the gaps in the argument. You may or may not be able to brainstorm any assumptions made by the author; it's worth spending about 15 to 20 seconds to try.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
            <p>Use an S-W-Slash Chart to keep track of the answers. Each answer choice will either strengthen the conclusion (S), weaken it (W), or do nothing to it (~). Label each letter on your scrap paper accordingly.</p>
            <p>Cross off W and ~ answers immediately. If you have more than one S, compare the answer choices. Only one choice will strengthen the conclusion in the end, so see whether you mistakenly labeled something an S when it should have been labeled something else. If they both still look good, then try to decide which one supports the conclusion more strongly. Pick and move on!</p>
            <p>At times it may not be entirely clear whether an answer choice strengthens or weakens the conclusion. For example, an answer choice may serve to strengthen the conclusion, but only in an indirect or arguable way. If that is the case, write down S~ in order to indicate that the answer choice is borderline. As you assess the other choices, determine whether you need to refine your categorization of that answer choice. Depending upon the other answer choices, it may be obvious that this answer choice is wrong or, alternatively, that it is the best answer.</p>
            <p><b>Wrong Answer Choice Types</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>No Tie to the Conclusion</b></li>
              <p>Many wrong answers will be tied to a premise but not to the conclusion. The answer choice could provide unnecessary information about that premise or talk about something tangential to the argument</p>
              <p>A few wrong answers with No Tie to the Conclusion do bring in language from the conclusion, but they do not meaningfully support the conclusion. Deceptive answers such as these seem relevant. Make sure that the answer you choose is not simply related to the conclusion, but in fact supports it.</p>
              <p>Also, some wrong answers can be Real-World Plausible. You are not assessing a choice's truth in the real world-only whether the choice strengthens the particular argument given.</p>
              <li><b>Wrong Direction</b></li>
              <p>Many wrong answers on Strengthen questions in fact weaken the argument. Make sure that you note whether a particular question is a Strengthen the Conclusion or a Weaken the Conclusion question so that you do not mistakenly pick the wrong answer. In the example provided above, answer choice (C) is an example of this deceptive answer type.</p>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Weaken the Conclusion</h5>
            <p>Weaken the Conclusion questions are exactly like Strengthen the Conclusion questions in every way except they want you to weaken instead of strengthen!</p>
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
            <p>The question stem may appear in a number of forms: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? </li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, could present the most serious disadvantage of XYZ Corporation's new marketing initiative? </li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the view that the drug treatment program will <i>not</i> be successful? </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
            <p>Weaken arguments will always contain conclusions; because your task is to weaken the conclusion, your first task is to find that conclusion. Also take note of the premises offered to support the conclusion, and think about the gaps in the argument. What is the author assuming must be true in order to draw that particular conclusion? You may or may not be able to brainstorm any assumptions made by the author; it's worth spending about 15 to 20 seconds to try.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
            <p>Use an S-W-slash chart to keep track of the answers. Each answer choice will either strengthen the conclusion (S), weaken it (W), or do nothing to it (~). Label each letter on your scrap paper accordingly.</p>
            <p>Cross off S and ~ answers immediately. If you have more than one W, compare the answer choices. Only one choice will weaken the conclusion in the end, so see whether you mistakenly labeled something a W when it should have been labeled something else. If they both still look good, then try to decide which one weakens the conclusion the most. Pick and move on!</p>
            <p>At times it may not be entirely clear whether an answer choice strengthens or weakens the conclusion. For example, an answer choice may serve to weaken the conclusion, but only in an indirect or arguable way. If that is the case, write down W~ in order to indicate that the answer choice is borderline. As you assess the other choices, determine whether you need to refine your categorization of that answer choice. Depending upon the other answer choices, it may be obvious that this answer choice is wrong or, alternatively, that it is the best answer.</p>
            <p><b>Wrong Answer Choice Types</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>No Tie to the Conclusion</b></li>
              <p>Many wrong answers are tied to a premise but not to the conclusion. Answer (A) in the previous problem is an example of a tempting wrong answer of the No Tie type.</p>
              <li><b>Wrong Direction</b></li>
              <p>Some wrong answers on Weaken questions in fact strengthen the argument. Make sure that you note whether a particular question is a Weaken the Conclusion or a Strengthen the Conclusion question so that you do not mistakenly pick the wrong answer. Answer (E) in the previous problem is a possible example of a Wrong Direction trap.</p>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h5>Analyze the Argument Structure</h5>
            <p>Analyze the Argument Structure questions ask you to describe the role of a part or parts of the argument.</p>
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
            <p>The question type will be immediately apparent because of the boldface font in portions of the argument. The question will typically ask what <i>role</i> the bold portions play in the overall argument.</p>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
            <p>The boldface portions can play one of three primary roles:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>(C): The statement in boldface is the author's <i>conclusion</i>. </li>
              <li>(S): The statement in boldface is a premise that <i>supports</i> the author's conclusion.</li>
              <li>(W): The statement in boldface is <i>something else</i> (usually <i>weakens</i> the conclusion, but not always). </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Find the author's conclusion, then classify each statement according to the categories C, S, or W. Do not go to the answer choices until you have found the conclusion and categorized the statements!</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
            <p>The wrong answers will provide descriptions of the wrong combination of categories. For example, you might decide that the first boldface is a C while the second is an S. One wrong answer might describe the combination C, W (in that order). Another might describe the combination W, C. Both would be wrong if you are looking for the combination C, S.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Draw a Conclusion (Inference)</h5>
            <p>You need to find the answer that logically follows, or must be true, based upon the information given in the argument. If you are asked to draw a conclusion or to infer something yourself, that conclusion must be able to be <i>proven</i> from the given premises. The conclusion should not require you to make any additional assumptions at all. The correct answer to a Draw a Conclusion question is <i>not</i> a claim or an arguable statement. Rather, the correct answer <i>must</i> be true based directly and only upon the information given in the argument. </p>
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
            <p>The question stem may appear in a number of forms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the statements above are true, which of the following must be true? </li>
              <li>Which of the following conclusions can best be drawn from the information above? </li>
              <li>The statements above, if true, best support which of the following assertions? </li>
              <li>Which of the following can properly be inferred from the statement above?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
            <p>Draw a Conclusion questions do not contain a conclusion in the argument. The argument will contain only premises and these premises will be primarily factual (though some might be more on the opinion or claim side). As with the other question types, jot down some light notes.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
            <p>Eliminate any answers that require additional assumptions or outside information in order to be true. The wrong answers will all include something that doesn't have to be true.</p>
            <p><b>Wrong Answer Choice Types</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>1. Out of Scope</b></li>
              <p>For Draw a Conclusion questions, Out of Scope answers require you to assume at least one piece of information not explicitly presented in the argument.</p>
              <p>A Real-World Plausible answer may even contain what people would reasonably surmise to be true in an article or conversation about the general topic. The Draw a Conclusion question type, however, requires you to find something that must be true according to the given premises, not something that could be true or merely sounds reasonable. If you cannot say that the premises prove an answer choice to be true, eliminate that answer choice. Do not bring external knowledge into the picture on Draw a Conclusion questions.</p>
              <li><b>2. Wrong Direction</b></li>
              <p>Wrong Direction answers might provide a conclusion that is the opposite of what the argument says. For example, a Wrong Direction answer choice for the argument above could just be the opposite of the correct answer.</p>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Resolve a Paradox</h5>
            <p>This question type poses two seemingly contradictory premises and asks you to find the answer choice that best reconciles them.</p>
            <p><b>Step 1: Identify the Question Type</b></p>
            <p>The question will often, though not always, indicate what the discrepancy is or provide a keyword pointing to the discrepancy in the argument. For example: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which of the following statements, if true, would best explain the sudden drop in temperature?</li>
              <li>Which of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the paradox described above?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Step 2: Deconstruct the Argument</b></p>
            <p>Like Draw a Conclusion passages, Paradox passages do not contain a conclusion in the argument. The argument will contain only premises, and these premises will be primarily factual (though some might be more on the opinion or claim side). Jot down some light notes, and articulate the paradox to yourself.</p>
            <p><b>Step 3: Work from Wrong to Right</b></p>
            <p>As with all ASPs, read through each answer. Eliminate choices that do not serve to explain or resolve the paradox presented in the argument.</p>
            <p><b>Wrong Answer Choice Types</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>1. Out of Scope</b></li>
              <p>A common wrong answer type will discuss something that is not at issue in the paradox. The people who intended to vote but didn't are not at issue in the argument. Alternatively, this type might address one of the premises but not actually address the discrepancy between the two premises.</p>
              <li><b>2. Wrong Direction</b></li>
              <p>A choice of this type will support the fact that the discrepancy exists rather than explain why there is not actually a discrepancy after all. Note that you are not supposed to explain why the apparent discrepancy exists. Rather, you must explain why the apparent discrepancy is not a real discrepancy after all.</p>

      <h2>Quantitative Comparison Questions</h2>
      <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
        <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Become familiar with the answer choices.</b> Quantitative Comparison questions always have the same answer choices, so get to know them, especially the last choice, "The relationship cannot be determined from the information given." Never select this last choice if it is clear that the values of the two quantities can be determined by computation. Also, if you determine that one quantity is greater than the other, make sure you carefully select the corresponding choice so as not to reverse the first two choices.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid unnecessary computations.</b> Don't waste time performing needless computations in order to compare the two quantities. Simplify, transform, or estimate one or both of the given quantities only as much as is necessary to compare them.</li>
          <li><b>Remember that geometric figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.</b> If any aspect of a given geometric figure is not fully determined, try to redraw the figure, keeping those aspects that are completely determined by the given information fixed but changing the aspects of the figure that are not determined. Examine the results. What variations are possible in the relative lengths of line segments or measures of angles?</li>
          <li><b>Plug in numbers.</b> If one or both of the quantities are algebraic expressions, you can substitute easy numbers for the variables and compare the resulting quantities in your analysis. Consider all kinds of appropriate numbers before you give an answer: e.g., zero, positive and negative numbers, small and large numbers, fractions and decimals. If you see that Quantity A is greater than Quantity B in one case and Quantity B is greater than Quantity A in another case, choose "The relationship cannot be determined from the information given."</li>
          <li><b>Simplify the comparison.</b> If both quantities are algebraic or arithmetic expressions and you cannot easily see a relationship between them, you can try to simplify the comparison. Try a step-by-step simplification that is similar to the steps involved when you solve the equation for <span class="my-math">`x`</span>, or similar to the <span class="my-math">`5 = 4x + 3`</span> steps involved when you determine that the inequality is equivalent <span class="my-math">`(3y+2)/5 \lt y`</span> to the simpler inequality Begin by setting up a comparison involving the <span class="my-math">`1 \lt y`</span>. two quantities, as follows:<p class="w3-center">QuantityA &#9072; QuantityB</p>&#9072; where is a "placeholder" that could represent the relationship greater than &#9072; (&gt;), less than (&lt;), or equal to (=) or could represent the fact that the relationship cannot be determined from the information given. Then try to simplify the comparison, step by step, until you can determine a relationship between simplified quantities. For example, you may conclude after the last step that represents equal to (=). Based on this conclusion, you may be able to &#9072; compare Quantities A and B. To understand this strategy more fully, see sample questions 6 to 9.</li>

      <h2>Select One Answer Questions</h2>
      <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
        <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Use the fact that the answer is there.</b> If your answer is not one of the five answer choices given, you should assume that your answer is incorrect and do the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Reread the question carefully-you may have missed an important detail or misinterpreted some information.</li>
            <li>Check your computations-you may have made a mistake, such as mis-keying a number on the calculator.</li>
            <li>Reevaluate your solution method-you may have a flaw in your reasoning.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Examine the answer choices.</b> In some questions you are asked explicitly which of the choices has a certain property. You may have to consider each choice separately, or you may be able to see a relationship between the choices that will help you find the answer more quickly. In other questions, it may be helpful to work backward from the choices, say, by substituting the choices in an equation or inequality to see which one works. However, be careful, as that method may take more time than using reasoning.</li>
          <li><b>For questions that require approximations, scan the answer choices to see how close an approximation is needed.</b> In other questions, too, it may be helpful to scan the choices briefly before solving the problem to get a better sense of what the question is asking. If computations are involved in the solution, it may be necessary to carry out all computations exactly and round only your final answer in order to get the required degree of accuracy. In other questions, you may find that estimation is sufficient and will help you avoid spending time on long computations.</li>

      <h2>Select One or More Answer Questions</h2>
      <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
        <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Note whether you are asked to indicate a specific number of answer choices or all choices that apply.</b> In the latter case, be sure to consider all of the choices, determine which ones are correct, and select all of those and only those choices. Note that there may be only one correct choice.</li>
          <li><b>In some questions that involve conditions that limit the possible values of numerical answer choices, it may be efficient to determine the least and/or the greatest possible value.</b> Knowing the least and/or greatest possible value may enable you to quickly determine all of the choices that are correct.</li>

      <h2>Numeric Entry Questions</h2>
      <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
        <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Make sure you answer the question that is asked.</b> Since there are no answer choices to guide you, read the question carefully and make sure you provide the type of answer required. Sometimes there will be labels before or after the answer box to indicate the appropriate type of answer. Pay special attention to units such as feet or miles, to orders of magnitude such as millions or billions, and to percents as compared with decimals.</li>
          <li><b>If you are asked to round your answer, make sure you round to the required degree of accuracy.</b> For example, if an answer of 46.7 is to be rounded to the nearest integer, you need to enter the number 47. If your solution strategy involves intermediate computations, you should carry out all computations exactly and round only your final answer in order to get the required degree of accuracy. If no rounding instructions are given, enter the exact answer.</li>
          <li><b>Examine your answer to see if it is reasonable with respect to the information given.</b> You may want to use estimation or another solution path to double-check your answer.</li>

      <h2>Data Interpretation Sets</h2>
      <section class="w3-light-gray w3-panel">
        <h5><i>Tips</i></h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Scan the data presentation briefly to see what it is about, but do not spend time studying all of the information in detail.</b> Focus on those aspects of the data that are necessary to answer the questions. Pay attention to the axes and scales of graphs; to the units of measurement or orders of magnitude (such as billions) that are given in the titles, labels, and legends; and to any notes that clarify the data.</li>
          <li><b>Bar graphs and circle graphs, as well as other graphical displays of data, are drawn to scale, so you can read or estimate data visually from such graphs.</b> For example, you can use the relative sizes of bars or sectors to compare the quantities that they represent, but be aware of broken scales and of bars that do not start at 0.</li>
          <li><b>The questions are to be answered only on the basis of the data presented, everyday facts (such as the number of days in a year), and your knowledge of mathematics.</b> Do not make use of specialized information you may recall from other sources about the particular context on which the questions are based unless the information can be derived from the data presented.</li>
