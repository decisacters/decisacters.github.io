          <h5>Type 1: Factual Information Questions</h5>
          <p>These questions ask you to identify factual information that is <u>explicitly stated</u>in the passage. Factual Information questions can focus on <b>facts</b>, <b>details</b>, <b>definitions</b>, or other information presented by the author. They ask you to identify specific information that is typically mentioned only in part of the passage. They generally do <u>not ask about general themes</u>that the passage as a whole discusses. Often the relevant information is <u>in one or two sentences</u>.</p>

          <li>organizing the information in the passage into a mental framework</li>
          <li>distinguishing <b>major</b> from minor ideas and essential from nonessential information</li>
          <li>understanding rhetorical functions such as cause-effect relationships, compare-contrast relationships, arguments, and the like</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reading to Learn questions require you to show that you are able not only to comprehend individual points, but also to <u>place the major ideas and supporting information from the passage into an organizational framework</u>or structure such as a prose summary or a table. By answering correctly, you will demonstrate that you can recognize the major points of a text, how and why the text has been organized, and the nature of the relationships within the text.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Too specific:</b> Watch out for choices that contain specific facts or details. Make sure you don't include examples! Remember, examples only support the main point; they don't state it.</li>
          <li><b>Not mentioned:</b> Make sure the information in the choice is actually found in the passage. Some answer choices are cleverly worded to distract you.</li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h5>Type 9: Prose Summary Questions</h5>
          <p>These items measure your ability to understand and recognize the major ideas and the relative importance of information in a passage. You will be asked to select the major ideas in the passage by <u>distinguishing them from minor ideas</u>or <u>ideas that are not in the passage</u>. The correct answer choice will synthesize major ideas in the passage. Because the correct answer represents a synthesis of ideas, it will not match any particular sentence from the passage. To select the correct answer, you will need to create a mental framework to organize and <b>remember major ideas</b> and other important information.</p>

          <h5>Type 10: Fill in a Table Questions</h5>
          <p>In Fill in a Table Questions, you must first recognize and identify the major points from the passage, and then place those points in their proper context. The distinction between major ideas/ important information and less important information can also be thought of as a distinction between essential and nonessential information.</p>
          <p>Passages used with Fill in a Table items have <b>more than one focus</b> of development in that they include more than one point of view or perspective. Typical passages have the following types of organization: <b>compare/contrast, problem/solution, cause/effect, alternative arguments</b>(such as theories, hypotheses), and the like.</p>
          <p><b><i>Correct</i></b> answers represent major ideas and important supporting information in the passage. Generally these answers will <b>not match specific phrases</b> in the passage. They are more likely to be abstract concepts based on passage information or paraphrases of passage information.</p>
          <p><b><i>Incorrect</i></b> answers may include information about the topic that is <b>not mentioned</b> in the passage or that is <b>not directly relevant</b> to the classification categories in the table.

        <h3>Improving Your Performance on TOEFL iBT Reading Questions</h3>
        <p>Here are some suggestions for ways to build skills for the three reading purposes covered by the TOEFL iBT test.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Reading to find information</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Scan passages to find and highlight key facts</u>(dates, numbers, terms) and information.</li>
              <li>Practice this frequently to increase reading rate and fluency.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Reading for basic comprehension</b>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Increase your vocabulary</u>knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards.</li>
              <li>Rather than carefully reading each word and each sentence, <u>practice skimming a passage quickly to get a general impression of the main idea</u>.</li>
              <li>Build up your ability to skim quickly and to identify the major points.</li>
              <li>After skimming a passage, read it again more carefully and write down the main idea, major points, and important facts.</li>
              <li><u>Choose some unfamiliar words in a passage and guess</u>the meaning from the context (surrounding sentences).</li>
              <li><u>Select all the pronouns and identify</u>which nouns they refer to in a passage.</li>
              <li>Practice <u>making inferences and drawing conclusions</u>based on what is implied in the passage as a whole.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Reading to learn</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Identify the passage type</b>(e.g., <b>classification, cause/effect, compare/contrast, problem/solution, description, narration,</b> and so on).</li>
              <li>Do the following to organize the information in the passage:<ul>
                  <li>Create an outline of the passage to distinguish between major and minor points.</li>
                  <li>If the passage categorizes information, create a chart and place the information in appropriate categories. Practicing this skill will help you think about categorizing information and be able to do so with ease.</li>
                  <li>If the passage describes the steps in a process, create an outline of the steps in their correct order.</li>
                  <li>Create a summary of the passage using the charts and outlines.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><u>Paraphrase individual sentences in a passage, and then progress to paraphrasing an entire paragraph.</u>The ability to paraphrase is also important for the integrated tasks in the Writing and Speaking sections of the test.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h3>CRACKING THE READING SECTION</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>BASIC PRINCIPLES</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>#1: It's in There!</b> The answer to every single question is found in the passage!</li>
          <li><b>#2: The Two-Pass System.</b> Do easy questions first, and save the hard questions for later.</li>
          <li><b>#3: Process of Elimination.</b> POE involves comparing answer choices and finding reasons to eliminate one or more.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In general, the wrong answers on the TOEFL Reading section fall into one of the following categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Not mentioned:</b> This category consists of information that is not found in the passage. On the TOEFL, every correct answer must be found in the passage.</li>
          <li><b>Extreme:</b> These answer choices use wording that is too strong or absolute. These choices usually include words such as <b>all, always, impossible, must, never, or none</b>. Correct answers on the TOEFL do not generally contain such strong language.</li>
          <li><b>Right answer, wrong question:</b> These choices contain information that is mentioned in the passage; however, the information doesn't answer the question.</li>
          <li>Verbatim: Many wrong answers repeat parts of the passage word for word. Unfortunately, the choices use these words in the wrong context or incorrectly. These answers can be especially tempting.</li>
          <li>Beyond the information: Choices in chis category are based on information in the passage, but they go beyond the given information.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>BASIC APPROACH</h4>
        <p>When approaching the Reading section of the TOEFL, follow these steps.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Actively read the passage, looking for the purpose, structure, and main idea.</b></li>
          <li><b>Find the answer to the question in the passage. Use POE to eliminate bad answers.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <section>
          <h5>Work on active reading</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Read the first sentence of each paragraph.</b> State what topic the author is writing about.</li>
            <li><b>Skim the rest of the paragraph for opposite-direction markers.</b> Pay particular attention to opposite-direction markers.</li>
            <li><b>Remember to read both the first sentence of each paragraph in the passage and last sentence of the conclusion.</b> The last sentence will contain the author's final point.</li>
            <li><b>The main idea should connect all the ideas found in the first sentences of the paragraphs and the last sentence of the conclusion.</b> If you're having trouble connecting all of the topics, ask yourself what the purpose of the passage is to help you put all the pieces together.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <p>Here is our general system for dealing with questions on the TOEFL.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Read and rephrase the question.</b> You'll notice that many questions on the TOEFL are not written in a straightforward manner. Before you head back to the passage to find the answer, make sure you understand what the question is asking you to find.</li>
          <li><b>Go back to the passage and find the answer.</b> The question will direct you to the appropriate part of the passage. Go back to the passage and read enough lines (usually 6-10) to get the context of the text. Never answer a question from memory alone because you're more likely to fall for a trap answer.</li>
          <li><b>Answer in your own words first.</b> This is the most important step of all. After returning to the passage and reading the appropriate part of it, you should be able to answer the question in your own words. If you can't, you may be reading the wrong part of the passage or you may need co read more lines.</li>
          <li><b>Use POE.</b> Once you have an idea of the type of answer for which you're looking, return to the question and use POE.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our strategy for <b>Factual, Vocabulary, Reference</b> question</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rephrase the question.</li>
          <li>Use <b>keywords</b> in the question to find the appropriate place in the passage.</li>
          <li>Read a few lines before and after (<b>based on the connection words</b> of the keyword sentence) the keywords.</li>
          <li>State the answer to the question in your own words.</li>
          <li>Eliminate answers that are not mentioned in the passage at all</li>
          <li>Eliminate answers that beyond the specific lines needed to answer the question</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our strategy for <b>Simplification, Insert</b> question is to eliminate the answer are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Doesn't match:</b> This is one of the easiest ways to eliminate an answer choice. If the information in the choice doesn't match the passage, it's wrong.</li>
          <li><b>New information:</b> Be very suspicious of answer choices that introduce new information. These choices are usually wrong.</li>
          <li><b>Half-right:</b> Read each choice carefully because wrong answers will typically match only half of the information in the passage or answer choice. Make sure all the information corresponds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>CRACKING THE LISTENING SECTION: BASIC APPROACH</h4>
        <section>
          <h5>Basic Principle #1: Find the Main Idea or Purpose</h5>
          <p><b>Lectures</b> are designed around a <b>main idea</b>, whereas <b>conversations</b> are centered on a <b>purpose</b>.</p>
          <p>In <b>lectures</b>, the speaker will typically introduce the main idea at the very beginning of the talk. Listen for phrases similar to the following: </p>
          <p><b>Main Topic Introduction Phrases</b></p>
          <p><span class="topic-phrases"><b>talk about</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>look at</b></span>, phrases indicate present: <span class="topic-phrases"><b>today</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>tonight</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>now</b></span>;</p>
          <p>In a <b>conversation</b>, the beginning sentences will reveal the speaker's purpose. Listen for the purpose to appear after an initial greeting</p>
          <p><b>Main Topic Introduction Phrases</b></p>
          <p><span class="topic-phrases"><b>can I do for you</b></span>, <span class="topic-phrases"><b>can I help you</b></span></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h5>Basic Principle #2: Focus on the Structure</h5>
          <p><b>Types of Lecture Structures</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><b>Compare/Contrast</b>: This type of lecture involves <u>finding similarities and differences between two or more things</u>. Listen for the speaker to introduce this <u>framework</u> by using one of the following phrases: "<b>several theories</b>" "<b>possible explanations</b>" "<b>many different views</b>". After the framework is introduced, the speaker will list each item to be discussed and mention its characteristics. Listen for words that indicate <u>compare/contrast</u>, such as: "<b>In contrast</b>" "<b>on the other hand</b>" "<b>similarly</b>" "<b>however</b>" "<b>additionally</b>" "<b>also</b>"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Cause-and-Effect</b>: Some lectures attempt to explain why a certain situation occurs. Listen for the speaker to introduce this type of <u>framework</u> with the following phrases: "<b>Why would this happen?</b>" "<b>What is the reason for this?</b>" "<b>How could this happen?</b>" "<b>What leads to this?</b>". A speaker will often use the following phrases to introduce the <u>cause</u> x: "<b>x causes y</b>", "<b>x results in y</b>", "<b>x produces y</b>", "<b>x leads toy</b>", "<b>x brings about y</b>", "<b>x is responsible for y</b>". After identifying the cause, look for the speaker to detail the <u>effects</u> y with a phrase similar to the following: "<b>y is caused by x</b>", "<b>y results from x</b>", "<b>y is due to x</b>", "<b>y can be blamed on x</b>", "<b>y is attributable to x</b>", "<b>y happens because of x</b>".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Abstract Category/Specific Examples</b>: Another common lecture structure involves moving from an abstract category to a specific example. A lecture may also sometimes begin with specific examples and end with a more general interpretation of the examples. A speaker may introduce an <u>abstract concept</u> with one of the following phrases: "<b>one approach ... </b>" "<b>one theory ... </b>" "<b>the idea is ... </b>" "<b>the concept ... </b>" "<b>the basic premise is ... </b>". Next, the speaker will move to the <u>examples</u>, typically using the following: "<b>for example ... </b>" "<b>one instance of this is ... </b>" "<b>consider ... </b>" "<b>we see this in/with ... </b>" "<b>this is illustrated by/with ... </b>".</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sequences</b>: A lecture may present a series of steps or stages. Listen for the lecturer to mention the following <u>clues</u>: "<b>process</b>" "<b>development</b>" "<b>stages</b>" "<b>transition</b>". The <u>steps</u> or parts will typically be introduced with clear transitions, such as: "<b>first ... second ... third ... </b>" "<b>next. .. </b>" "<b>then ... </b>" "<b>initially ... </b>" "<b>finally ... </b>".</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Types of Conversation Structures</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><b>Problem/Solution</b>: <u>One student has a problem, and another student offers advice or a possible solution</u>. Listen for the first student to introduce the <u>problem</u> by mentioning one of the following: "<b>problem</b>" "<b>issue</b>" "<b>difficulty</b>" "<b>trouble</b>". After describing the problem, the other person will offer some sore of advice or <u>solution</u>. Listen for the following phrases: "<b>why don't you ... </b>" "<b>if I were you, I'd ... </b>" "<b>maybe you should ... </b>" "<b>have you tried/thought of..</b>"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Service Encounter</b>: In this encounter, a student will <u>discuss a problem with a professional</u>-usually a <b>professor</b>, a librarian, or an <b>office worker</b>. The service professional will usually explain exactly what the student needs to do to solve the problem. The solution may involve several parts. Listen for the following words to indicate the <u>steps</u> the student muse cake: "<b>requirement</b>" "<b>application</b>" "<b>form</b>" "<b>recommendation</b>" "<b>prohibited</b>".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Significant Event</b>: This could be <u>a meeting, an announcement, or a social event</u>. Usually, the first speaker will introduce the <u>event</u> with one of the following phrases: "<b>have you heard about ... </b>" "<b>did you see ... </b>" "<b>let you know about ... </b>" "<b>program/event/opportunity/chance</b>". After noting the event, listen to any details about it. Also note what the speaker's plans are concerning the event. Listen for the following key words: "<b>participate</b>" "<b>plans</b>" "<b>open co</b>" "<b>free" or "busy</b>".</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h5>Basic Principle #3: Listen for Tone and Attitude</h5>
          <p>The tone of most <b>lectures</b> is fairly straightforward. Because the speaker is teaching a class, the tone will usually be similar to one of the following types: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Objective</b>: The speaker is simply listing facts or providing information. The speaker is an authority on his or her subject and so will not be unsure or uncertain about the topic. This type of tone can appear in <b>any of the four</b> common lecture types.</li>
            <li><b>Subjective</b>: In some cases, the speaker will be presenting a position or making an argument. The speaker will try to convince the listeners about a certain view. This type of tone is more likely to appear in <b>compare/contrast and cause-and-effect</b> lectures.</li>
            <li><b>Inquisitive</b>: There are also classroom discussions on the TOEFL. During a discussion, the professor leads the class through a number of questions, so the tone is inquisitive. The professor considers and responds to the students' questions as the lecture progresses. <b>Abstract category/specific example</b> lectures typically involve discussion, although other lecture types may as well.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Conversations tend to have slightly more personal tones. You can expect the tone to be similar to one of the following types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Excited</b>: This tone is typical of the <b>significant event</b> conversation. The speaker is interested in the event and may be trying to influence others about it.</li>
            <li><b>Disappointed/upset</b>: In this case, the speaker is not happy about the situation. He or she may express dissatisfaction with things or events. This usually occurs during the <b>problem/solution</b> encounter, although it can appear in other conversations too.</li>
            <li><b>Uncertain or confused</b>: Sometimes the speaker is uncertain or confused, especially in <b>service encounters</b>. The speaker will be unsure of what action to take or how to proceed.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h5>Basic Principle #4: Pay Attention to Transitions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Reversal Transitions</b>: Often, speakers on the TOEFL will reverse the direction or logic of the conversation or lecture. Here are some phrases for which to listen. "<b>you know what?</b>" "<b>we'll come back to that in a moment</b>" "<b>actually, let's</b>" "<b>instead</b>" "<b>better yet</b>" "<b>I don't want to get into that now</b>"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Negation Transitions</b>: Also, speakers will sometimes use a positive word to indicate a negation. Look for phrases like the following, where the negation words are italicized: "<b>I don't have to explain that, right?</b>" "<b>You guys are okay with this, correct?</b>" "<b>We don't need to go into that now, okay?</b>" In each case, the speaker uses a positive word to express a negative statement. When used in this way, the positive words indicate that <u>the speaker assumes the listener knows what the speaker is talking about and no further discussion or explanation is needed</u>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h3 class="my-color w3-padding">Basic Strategies for the TOEFL iBT Listening Section</h3>
      <p>Here are some ways you can strengthen skills for the three listening purposes tested on the TOEFL iBT test.</p>
      <li>When listening to a lecture, pay attention to the new words or concepts introduced by the professor. These will often be tested.</li>
      <li>When listening to a lecture, pay attention to the way the lecture is organized and the way the ideas in the lecture are connected.</li>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Listening for Basic Comprehension</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Increase your vocabulary knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards.</li>
            <li><u>Anticipate what the speaker is going to say</u> as a way to stay focused, and <u>adjust your predictions when you receive additional information</u>.</li>
            <li>Stay active by asking yourself questions (e.g., What main idea is the professor communicating?).</li>
            <li>Copy the words "main idea," "major points," and "important details" on different lines of paper. Listen carefully and write these things down while listening. Listen again until all important points and details are written down.</li>
            <li>Listen to a portion of a lecture or talk and write a brief summary of important points. Gradually increase the amount you listen to and summarize. Note: Summarizing skills are not tested in the Listening section, but they are useful for the integrated tasks in the Writing and Speaking sections.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Listening for Pragmatic Understanding</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Think about what each speaker hopes to accomplish; that is, what is the purpose of the speech or conversation? Is the speaker apologizing, complaining, making suggestions?</li>
            <li>Notice the way each speaker talks. Is the language formal or casual? How certain does each speaker sound? Is the speaker's voice calm or emotional? What does the speaker's tone of voice tell you?</li>
            <li>Notice the degree of certainty of the speaker. How sure is the speaker about the information? Does the speaker's tone of voice indicate something about his or her degree of certainty?</li>
            <li>Listen for <b>changes in topic or side comments</b> in which the speaker briefly moves away from the main topic and then returns (digressions).</li>
            <li>Watch television or movie comedies and pay attention to stress and intonation patterns used to convey meaning.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Listening to Connect Ideas</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Think about how the lecture is organized. Listen for the <b>signal words</b> that indicate the introduction, major steps or ideas, examples, and the conclusion or summary.</li>
            <li>Identify the relationships between ideas in the information being discussed. Possible relationships include: cause-and-effect, compare-and-contrast, steps in a process.</li>
            <li>Listen for words that show connections and relationships between ideas.</li>
            <li>When you listen to recorded material, stop the recording at various points and try to predict what information or idea will be expressed next.</li>
            <li>Create an outline of the information discussed while listening or after listening</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    <h2>Speaking</h2>
    <p>In the Speaking section you will be asked to speak on a variety of topics that <b>draw on personal experience(1, 2)</b>, <b>campus-based situations(3, 4)</b>, and <b>academic-type content material(5, 6)</b>.</p>
    <p>Although scoring criteria vary somewhat depending on the question, the raters will generally be listening for the following features in your answer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Delivery</b>: How clear your speech is. Good responses are those in which the speech is fluid and clear, with good pronunciation, natural pacing, and natural-sounding intonation patterns.</li>
      <li><b>Language Use</b>: How effectively you use grammar and vocabulary to convey your ideas. Raters will be listening for how well you can control both basic and more complex language structures and use appropriate vocabulary.</li>
      <li><b>Topic Development</b>: How fully you answer the question and how coherently you present your ideas. Good responses generally use all or most of the time allotted, and the relationship between ideas and the progression from one idea to the next is clear and easy to follow.</li>
    </ul>
    <section>
      <h4>Independent: Questions 1 and 2</h4>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 1</h5>
        <p>For this task, you will be asked to speak about a <u>person</u>, <u>place</u>, <u>object</u>, or <u>event</u> that is familiar to you. You might, for example, be asked about <b>a place you like to visit</b>, <b>an important event in your life</b>, <b>a person who influenced you</b>, or <b>an activity that you enjoy</b>.</p>
        <p>This question will always ask you both to <b><i>describe</i></b> something and to <b><i>give reasons</i></b> to explain <b>why the event was important</b>, <b>why the activity is one of your favorites</b>, <b>how the person influenced you</b>, etc. Your response should include specific details and/or examples because they will make your description informative and your reasons comprehensible.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 2</h5>
        <p>In this second Independent Speaking Task, you will be presented with <u>two</u> possible <b>actions, situations, or opinions</b>. Then you will be asked to say <b>which of the actions or situations you think is preferable</b> or <b>which opinion you think is more justified</b> and then explain your choice by providing reasons and details. Topics for this question include <b>everyday issues of general interest</b> to a student. You could also be presented with <b>two opposing opinions about a familiar topic</b>.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Integrated Reading/Listening/Speaking: Questions 3 and 4</h4>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 3</h5>
        <p>The general areas from which these topics are typically drawn include <u>university policies, rules, or procedures</u>; <u>university plans</u>; <u>campus facilities</u>; and <u>quality of life on campus</u>.</p>
        <p>The reading passage could take various forms. For example, it could be <u>a bulletin from the administration</u> of a university regarding a new parking rule, or <u>a letter to the editor of a campus newspaper responding to a new university policy</u> restricting the use of radios in dormitory rooms, or <u>an article from the campus newspaper</u> discussing a proposal to build a new football stadium. </p>
        <p>Therefore as you read the reading passage, you should pay attention to a number of things: <b>the description of the proposal</b>, and the <b>reasons that are given</b> for the proposal. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 4</h5>
        <p>The reading passage will usually treat the topic in somewhat general and <b>abstract terms</b>, and the lecture will treat the topic more specifically and concretely, often by providing an <b>extended example</b>, counterexample, or <b>application of the concept</b> presented in the reading.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Integrated Listening/Speaking: Questions 5 and 6</h4>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 5</h5>
        <p>Typically, the speakers in the conversation will be <u>students</u>, or <u>a student and a professor</u>, or <u>a student and a university staff member</u> (for example, a teaching assistant, librarian, or administrator). The problems may involve such issues as <u>scheduling conflicts</u>, <u>unavoidable absences</u>, <u>unavailable resources</u>, <u>student elections</u>, <u>financial difficulties</u>, and so forth. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>Question 6</h5>
        <p>The lectures can be about processes, methods, theories, ideas, or phenomena of any type-natural, social, psychological, and others. If a lecture is about a <u>process</u>, the professor might explain the process by describing some of its <b>functions</b>. In a lecture about a <u>theory</u>, the professor might explain the theory by describing its <b>applications</b>. In a lecture about a <u>phenomenon</u>, the professor might explain it through examples that illustrate its <b>causes</b> or its <b>effects</b>.</p>

      <h3>Core Concept: Speaking</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 1: STATING YOUR PURPOSE</h4>
        <p>For speaking tasks that ask you to present your opinion or to describe something personal to you, use the following introductory phrases(<u>subjective phrases</u>): <span class="phrases"><b>I believe, I think, I feel, My view is, My opinion is, My preference is.</b></span></p>
        <p>For speaking tasks that require you to summarize someone else's opinion or to explain facts, the following introductions are appropriate(<u>objective phrases</u>): <span class="phrases">This person <b>believes</b> that, This person <b>holds</b> that, This person <b>argues</b> that, This person's <b>view</b> is that, This person's <b>point</b> is that, The lecture <b>stated</b>, The reading stated, The reading <b>presented</b>, The lecture <b>offered</b></span>.</p>
        <p>The three points you need to convey in your introduction are</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Purpose</b>: Your task.</li>
          <li><b>Thesis</b>: Your topic. The thesis is basically a statement of your position or belief on a topic or your main idea. It will be slightly different based on what you are trying to accomplish in your spoken response.</li>
          <li><b>Why</b>: After introducing the topic, state why you are discussing it. Theanswer to this why question should relate back to the purpose.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 2: ORGANIZING YOUR IDEAS</h4>
        <p>A good body paragraph contains the following elements: A <b>topic sentence</b> that introduces the main point of the paragraph. <b>Examples, facts, and evidence</b> that help the author achieve his or her purpose.</p>
        <p><b>Step 1: Provide a Topic Sentence</b></p>
        <p>A good topic sentence does two things: It <u>provides a transition between ideas</u> and <u>clearly states that main idea</u> of the paragraph. A good topic sentence is one that indicates a <b>progression</b> of ideas by using the phrase: <span class="phrases"><b>One reason, Another reason, Additionally, Third, First, Moreover, Second, Furthermore</b></span>.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Make Your Case with Examples</b></p>
        <p>Your examples should be: <b>Specific</b>: They should not be vague or too general. <b>Explained</b>: Make sure you give details to support your examples.</p>
        <p>Use the following <b>template</b> to articulate your examples:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Statement 1: State your example and tie it back to your thesis.</li>
          <li>Statement 2: Give one reason why your example is relevant to your thesis.</li>
          <li>Statement 3: Add detail to reason #1.</li>
          <li>Statement 4: Give another reason why your example is relevant to your thesis.</li>
          <li>Statement 5: Add detail to reason #2.</li>
          <li>Statement 6 (optional): Provide a summary of your reasons and relate them to your thesis. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Make sure your examples and your structure are organized. Remember to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>State the example.</li>
          <li>Explain how the example supports your position.</li>
          <li>Transitions: Provide a topic sentence or transition statement to move from one example to the next.</li>
          <li>Details: Support each example with details.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 3: WRAPPING THINGS UP: THE CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p>A conclusion has to do one thing and one thing only. Restate your thesis.</p>
        <p>Here are some good words and phrases to use for your final paragraph: <span class="phrases"><b>And so, Ultimately, In conclusion, As I've stated, Finally, Clearly, As this essay has demonstrated, Thus, To sum up</b></span>. </p>

          <p>For this task, you will be asked to speak about a <b>person</b>, <b>place</b>, <b>object</b>, or <b>event</b> that is familiar to you. You might, for example, be asked about <b>a place you like to visit</b>, <b>an important event in your life</b>, <b>a person who influenced you</b>, or <b>an activity that you enjoy</b>.</p>
          <p>This question will always ask you both to <b><i>describe</i></b> something and to <b><i>give reasons</i></b> to explain <b>why the event was important</b>, <b>why the activity is one of your favorites</b>, <b>how the person influenced you</b>, etc. Your response should include specific details and/or examples because they will make your description informative and your reasons comprehensible.</p>
          <section>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <p class="w3-padding w3-border">1. Choose a <b>teacher you admire</b> and explain why you admire him or her. Please include specific examples and details in your explanation.</p>
            <p>To answer a question like the one above, you would probably begin by briefly identifying the <b>teacher(person)</b> you are going to speak about. For example, what subject did the teacher teach? How old were you when you had him or her as a teacher?</p>
            <p>After briefly describing the teacher in whatever way is useful, you could then proceed to explain <u>what it was about the teacher that made you admire him or her</u>. Perhaps it was <b>something specific that he or she did</b>. If so, you should <u>describe what the teacher did and provide details that illustrate why the action was admirable</u>. Maybe the teacher <b>displayed a special personal quality or had a special character trait</b>. If so, you would want to <u>describe it and give details that provide evidence of it-occasions when you noticed it, the effect it had on you, and so forth</u>.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h5>Question 2</h5>
          <p>In this second Independent Speaking Task, you will be presented with <u>two</u> possible <b>actions, situations, or opinions</b>. Then you will be asked to say <b>which of the actions or situations you think is preferable</b> or <b>which opinion you think is more justified</b> and then explain your choice by providing reasons and details. Topics for this question include <b>everyday issues of general interest</b> to a student. You could also be presented with <b>two opposing opinions about a familiar topic</b>.</p>
          <section>
            <h6>Example</h6>
            <p class="w3-padding w3-border">2. Some students study for classes <b>individually</b>. Others study <b>in groups</b>. Which method of studying do you think is better for students and why?</p>
            <p>In answering a question like this one, it is important that you begin by clearly stating what your opinion is. As for the reasons you give in support of your opinion, they can vary widely and may be based on your own experience and observations.</p>
            <p>For example, if the position you take is that it is better for students to <b>study alone</b>, you might say that <u>when students meet to study in groups, they often waste time discussing matters that have nothing to do with their class work</u>. You might continue this explanation by <b>contrasting the inefficiency of studying in a group with the kind of productivity a student can achieve when studying alone</b>.</p>
            <p>Or perhaps you want to take the opposite position, that it is better for students to <b>study in groups</b>. In that case, you would explain the <u>advantages of group study and the disadvantages of studying alone</u>. Perhaps you think that <u>the more capable students can help the less capable students when students study together</u>. Or perhaps you have found that <u>students who study in groups often share each others' lecture notes, and this way they can make sure everyone understands all the material that has been covered in a course</u>.</p>

      <h3>Core Concept: Writing</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 1: EXPRESSING YOUR PURPOSE</h4>
        <p>Most writing tasks on the TOEFL ask you to do one of the following: Present your opinion on an issue (a value essay, <b>Independent</b>). Evaluate the information on a topic (a fact essay, <b>Integrated</b>). </p>
        <p>In general, your introduction needs to accomplish the following tasks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Introduce the topic of your discussion.</li>
          <li>Present your thesis statement.</li>
        </ol>
        <section>
          <h5>Writing an Effective Introduction Paragraph</h5>
          <p><b>Step 1: State Your Position</b></p>
          <p>It's best to make a clear, direct statement of your position. Try using some of the following phrases:<span class="phrases"><b>I believe, I feel that, In my opinion, In my view, I think that, I do not believe, I do not feel that, My position is, It is my belief that</b></span>. </p>
          <p><b>Step 2: State the Reason for Your Opinion</b></p>
          <p>When stating why you believe your position, it may be helpful to use some of the following phrases: <span class="phrases"><b>I believe this because, I feel this way because, The reason I think this is, This is because, Since</b></span> </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 2: ORGANIZING YOUR IDEAS</h4>
        <section>
          <h5>Writing an Effective Body Paragraph</h5>
          <p><b>Step 1: The Topic Sentence</b></p>
          <p>A topic sentence should introduce the main point of the paragraph. To make a clear transition statement, use the topic or thesis of the previous paragraph as a starting point. repeats an idea found in the last sentence of the introduction. Using this technique makes your writing flow better and appear more organized.</p>
          <p><b>Step 2: The Examples</b></p>
          <p>your model is still the same. state the example or reason (what the example is), explain its significance (why the example is important)</p>
          <p><b>Supporting Examples</b>: They are used to show the reader why you have a particular viewpoint or position. </p>
          <p><b>Summarizing Examples</b>: Some tasks require you to explain or summarize someone else's opinion. For these tasks, you are not trying to convince the reader of anything; instead, your purpose is to report what you've read or heard.</p>
          <p><b>The Example Template</b></p>
          <p>When you use an example in an essay, try to follow this template.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Sentence 1: Introduce the example and tie it back to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Sentence 2: State one reason why your example is important or relevant to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Sentence 3: Add detail to reason #1.</li>
            <li>Sentence 4: State another reason why your example is important or relevant to your thesis.</li>
            <li>Sentence 5: Add detail to reason #2.</li>
            <li>Sentence 6 (optional): Provide a summary of your reasons, and relate them back to your thesis.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>PART 3: CONCLUDING YOUR RESPONSE</h4>
        <p>A conclusion has to be only two or three sentences long. After you restate your thesis, repeat your reasons or make a final statement about the correctness of your views. </p>

          <h5>Strategies for Raising Your Score on the Integrated Writing Task</h5>
          <p><b>As you read:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The main idea often has to do with some <b>policy</b> or <b>practice</b> or some <b>position</b> on an issue. Or it may have to do with <b>proposing</b> some overall <b>hypothesis</b> about the way some <b>process</b> or <b>procedure</b> works.</li>
            <li>See how this main idea is <b>evaluated</b> or <b>developed</b>: <b>Arguments</b> or <b>explanations</b> are presented that support/doubt the main position. Policy or practice will (not) be <b>beneficial</b> or <b>prove useful</b> or <b>advisable</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>As you listen:</b></p>
          <p>Listen for <b>information</b>, <b>examples</b>, or <b>explanations</b> that make points in the reading passage seem <b>wrong</b> or <b>less convincing</b> or even <b>untrue</b></p>
          <p><b>As you write your response:</b></p>
          <p>Your response should contain the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The <b>specific ideas</b>, <b>explanations</b>, and <b>arguments</b> in the lecture that <b>oppose</b> or <b>challenge</b> points in the reading.</li>
            <li><b>Coherent and accurate presentations of each point</b> that you make; that is, the language you use should make sense and should accurately reflect the ideas presented in the lecture and the reading.</li>
            <li><b>A clear, coherent structure</b> that enables the reader to understand what points in the lecture relate to what points in the reading.</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>main point is in the end or middle of the first paragraph</b>, rarely in the beginning of it.</li>
            <li><b>Sub point is the first or last sentence</b> of the supporting paragraph.</li>
            <li><b>Using Reading passage sub point details to focus</b> on the listening passage.</li>
            <li>Try to write down as many <b>detail keywords in the listening passage</b> as possible.</li>
            <li>Noticed the <b>Proper Nouns</b> in the Reading Passage.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Independent Writing</h4>
        <p><b>Development</b> is the amount and kinds of support (<b>details</b>, <b>examples</b>, <b>reasons</b>) for your ideas that you present in your essay. The raters will judge whether you have addressed the topic and how well your <b>details</b>, <b>examples</b>, <b>reasons</b> support your ideas.</p>
        <p><b>Organization</b> is something that raters notice-when you fail to organize. Writing in paragraphs and <b>marking transitions from one idea to another in various ways</b> usually helps the reader to follow your ideas. But be aware that just using transition words such as first or second does not guarantee that your essay is organized. The <b>points you make must all relate to the topic</b> of the essay and to the main idea you are presenting in response. To earn a top score, you need to <b>avoid <del>redundancy</del></b> (repetition of ideas), <b><del>digression</del></b> (points that are not related to your main point, that take away from the "unity" of your ideas), and <b><del>unclear connections</del></b> (places where it is hard for the reader to understand how two ideas or parts of your writing are related).</p>
        <p><b>Language</b> use is the third criterion on which your essay will be judged. There should be <b>a variety of sentence structures</b>, and <b>word choice should be appropriate</b>. If your essay includes a few minor lexical or grammar errors, you can still get a high score.</p>

It is incomplete if it omits key ideas, makes vague reference to key ideas, or demonstrates limited development of important information.
