        <section>
          <h4>Use the resume summary</h4>
          <p>Got plenty of years bending HTML to your will? Use the resume summary. The summary statement, also known as a qualifications summary, is a brief paragraph highlighting your front end development <i>experience, skills, and achievements</i>.

          <section>

        <section>
          <h4>Use a resume objective</h4>
          <p>What if you're a newbie to the world of professional front end development? A career objective is perfect for those writing a resume objective with no work experience in web development.

        <h3>What Is a Chronological Resume?</h3>
        <p>A chronological resume is a resume format that highlights your experience and key professional achievements. It's also known as the reverse-chronological resume because your latest position comes up top and the previous ones follow. Chronological resumes are easiest to scan for the ATS or <a href="wiki">Applicant Tracking Systems</a>. That's what gives this format an additional edge in today's hiring if it is a ATS Resume.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Who Is the Chronological Resume Good For?</h3>
        <p>The reverse-chronological resume is most advantageous when:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have several years of professional experience.</li>
          <li>Your career progression has been steady, and preferably in one industry.</li>
          <li>You don't have gaps in employment on a resume.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're making a recent college grad resume, for example, you only need to rearrange the order of your resume sections, and put the education resume section first. Just make sure the entries in each section follow the reverse-chronological order.</p>

The ATS scores candidates' resumes according to certain preset criteria and shows the recruiter which candidates are the best fit for the advertised position.
